Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ["IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription regulator of cellular responses in many cell types that is known to be essential for innate immunity. To confirm IRF3's broad role in immunity and to more fully discern its role in various cellular subsets, we engineered <i>Irf3</i>-floxed mice to allow for the cell type-specific ablation of <i>Irf3</i> Analysis of these mice confirmed the general requirement of IRF3 for the evocation of type I IFN responses in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, immune cell ontogeny and frequencies of immune cell types were unaffected when <i>Irf3</i> was selectively inactivated in either T cells or B cells in the mice. Interestingly, in a model of lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, selective <i>Irf3</i> deficiency in myeloid cells led to reduced levels of type I IFN in the sera and increased survival of these mice, indicating the myeloid-specific, pathogenic role of the Toll-like receptor 4-IRF3 type I IFN axis in this model of sepsis. Thus, <i>Irf3</i>-floxed mice can serve as useful tool for further exploring the cell type-specific functions of this transcription factor."]
