The methyltransferase PRMT6 attenuates antiviral innate immunity by blocking TBK1-IRF3 signaling. 29973649 Cellular & molecular immunology [u'Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) play diverse biological roles and are specifically involved in immune cell development and inflammation. However, their role in antiviral innate immunity has not been elucidated. Viral infection triggers the TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway to stimulate the production of type-I interferon, which mediates antiviral immunity. We performed a functional screen of the nine mammalian PRMTs for regulators of IFN-\u03b2 expression and found that PRMT6 inhibits the antiviral innate immune response. Viral infection also upregulated PRMT6 protein levels. We generated PRMT6-deficient mice and found that they exhibited enhanced antiviral innate immunity. PRMT6 deficiency promoted the TBK1-IRF3 interaction and subsequently enhanced IRF3 activation and type-I interferon production. Mechanistically, viral infection enhanced the binding of PRMT6 to IRF3 and inhibited the interaction between IRF3 and TBK1; this mechanism was independent of PRMT6 methyltransferase activity. Thus, PRMT6 inhibits antiviral innate immunity by sequestering IRF3, thereby blocking TBK1-IRF3 signaling. Our work demonstrates a methyltransferase-independent role for PRMTs. It also identifies a negative regulator of the antiviral immune response, which may protect the host from the damaging effects of an overactive immune system and/or be exploited by viruses to escape immune detection.'] 
Revisiting the role of IRF3 in inflammation and immunity by conditional and specifically targeted gene ablation in mice. 29712834 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ["IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription regulator of cellular responses in many cell types that is known to be essential for innate immunity. To confirm IRF3's broad role in immunity and to more fully discern its role in various cellular subsets, we engineered <i>Irf3</i>-floxed mice to allow for the cell type-specific ablation of <i>Irf3</i> Analysis of these mice confirmed the general requirement of IRF3 for the evocation of type I IFN responses in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, immune cell ontogeny and frequencies of immune cell types were unaffected when <i>Irf3</i> was selectively inactivated in either T cells or B cells in the mice. Interestingly, in a model of lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, selective <i>Irf3</i> deficiency in myeloid cells led to reduced levels of type I IFN in the sera and increased survival of these mice, indicating the myeloid-specific, pathogenic role of the Toll-like receptor 4-IRF3 type I IFN axis in this model of sepsis. Thus, <i>Irf3</i>-floxed mice can serve as useful tool for further exploring the cell type-specific functions of this transcription factor."] 

Activation of the STING-IRF3 pathway promotes hepatocyte inflammation, apoptosis and induces metabolic disorders in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 29106945 Metabolism: clinical and experimental [StringElement('Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common result of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Hepatocyte injury and metabolic disorders are hallmarks of NAFLD. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its downstream factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) trigger inflammatory reaction in response to the presence of cytosolic DNA. STING has recently been shown to play an important role in early alcoholic liver disease. However, little is known about the role of STING-IRF3 pathway in hepatocyte injury.

TANK-Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) Isoforms Negatively Regulate Type I Interferon Induction by Inhibiting TBK1-IRF3 Interaction and IRF3 Phosphorylation. 29441066 Frontiers in immunology [u'TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is an important serine/threonine-protein kinase that mediates phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, which contributes to induction of type I interferons (IFNs) in the innate antiviral response. In mammals, TBK1 spliced isoform negatively regulates the virus-triggered IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction between retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondria antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). However, it is still unclear whether alternative splicing patterns and the function of TBK1 isoform(s) exist in teleost fish. In this study, we identify two alternatively spliced isoforms of TBK1 from zebrafish, termed TBK1_tv1 and TBK1_tv2. Both TBK1_tv1 and TBK1_tv2 contain an incomplete STKc_TBK1 domain. Moreover, the UBL_TBK1_like domain is also missing for TBK1_tv2. <i>TBK1_tv1</i> and <i>TBK1_tv2</i> are expressed in zebrafish larvae. Overexpression of TBK1_tv1 and TBK1_tv2 inhibits RIG-I-, MAVS-, TBK1-, and IRF3-mediated activation of IFN promoters in response to spring viremia of carp virus infection. Also, <i>TBK1_tv1</i> and <i>TBK1_tv2</i> inhibit expression of <i>IFNs</i> and IFN-stimulated genes induced by <i>MAVS</i> and <i>TBK1</i>. Mechanistically, TBK1_tv1 and TBK1_tv2 competitively associate with TBK1 and IRF3 to disrupt the formation of a functional TBK1-IRF3 complex, impeding the phosphorylation of IRF3 mediated by TBK1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TBK1 spliced isoforms are dominant negative regulators in the RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1/IRF3 antiviral pathway by targeting the functional TBK1-IRF3 complex formation. Identification and functional characterization of piscine TBK1 spliced isoforms may contribute to understanding the role of TBK1 expression in innate antiviral response.']
