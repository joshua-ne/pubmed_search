25497010 Currently the full-text not available Restoration of IRF1-dependent anticancer effects by MEK inhibition in human cancer cells. Cancer letters ['Interferon regulatory factor (IRF1) is a potent antiviral, antitumor and immune regulatory protein. Recently, we found that activated Ras/MEK inhibits antiviral response by downregulating IRF1 expression and renders cancer cells susceptible to oncolytic viruses. In this study, we sought to determine whether IRF1 downregulation underlies oncogenesis induced by Ras/MEK activation in human cancer cells. Treatment of the MEK inhibitor U0126 promoted IRF1 expression in 7 of 11 cancer cell lines we tested. IRF1 promotion was also observed in human cancer cell lines treated with different MEK inhibitors or with RNAi oligonucleotides against extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Restoration of the expression of antitumor genes, p27 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), by MEK inhibition was less in IRF1 shRNA knockdown cancer cells than in vector control cancer cells, suggesting that Ras/MEK targets IRF1 for the downregulation of the antitumor genes. Moreover, apoptosis induction by U0126 was significantly reduced in IRF1 shRNA knockdown cells than vector control cells. This study demonstrates that IRF1 expression is suppressed by activated Ras/MEK in human cancer cells and that IRF1 plays essential roles in apoptosis induced by Ras/MEK inhibition.']
