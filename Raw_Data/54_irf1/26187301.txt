26187301 Currently the full-text not available Molecular characterization of three IRF1 subfamily members reveals evolutionary significance of IRF11 in miiuy croaker. Developmental and comparative immunology ['The interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF2 of the IRF1 subfamily play essential roles in immune responses against viruses. IRF11 is a novel IRF gene of the IRF1 subfamily; IRF11 genes share almost the same evolutionary distance with IRF1 and IRF2 genes. However, the structure and characteristics of IRF11 gene in fish have been rarely reported. In our study, IRF1, IRF2 and IRF11 genes were identified and characterized from miiuy croaker genome. Results showed that the IRF1, IRF2 and IRF11 genes contain the same domains; each of these genes is composed of conserved gene organizations and characterized by gene synteny with the orthologous genes. Interestingly, IRF11 was likely found only in fish (but not specific to teleost fish). Evolutionary analysis results showed that IRF1 gene in mammals, IRF2 and IRF11 gene in fish underwent positive selection. IRF1, IRF2 and IRF11 were expressed in a wide range of miiuy croaker tissues. These genes also exhibited the same expression patterns after miiuy croaker was infected with poly(I:C). Therefore, our data enhanced our understanding of the functions and evolution of IRF11 in fish.']
