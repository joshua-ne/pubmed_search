19141455 Co-localization of constituents of the dengue virus translation and replication machinery with amphisomes. ['Infections with dengue virus (DENV) are a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. However, little detail is known about how DENV interacts with the host-cell machinery to facilitate its translation and replication. In DENV-infected HepG2 cells, an increase in the level of LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 form II), the autophagosomal membrane-bound form of LC3, was observed, and LC3 was found to co-localize with dsRNA and DENV NS1 protein, as well as ribosomal protein L28, indicating the presence of at least some of the DENV translation/replication machinery on autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of fusion of autophagic vacuoles with lysosomes resulted in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular virus, and co-localization observed between mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and dsRNA and between MPR and LC3 identified the autophagic vacuoles as amphisomes. Amphisomes are formed as a result of fusion between endosomal and autophagic vacuoles, and as such provide a direct link between virus entry and subsequent replication and translation.']
