24309426 STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing pathways. ['STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) has recently been identified as being essential for controlling host defense countermeasures triggered by microbial cytosolic DNA and subsequently cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). However, chronic STING activation may also be responsible for initiating certain inflammatory diseases manifested by self DNA. Recent studies have also revealed a key role for cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in STING activation. Although a full understanding of the mechanisms of STING activation requires further studies, new insights into STING function afford the opportunity of designing novel compounds aimed at facilitating vaccine development or new therapies for the treatment of inflammatory disease.']
