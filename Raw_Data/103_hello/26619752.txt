The International journal on drug policy [StringElement('Hello Sunday Morning (HSM) is an online program that encourages people to commit to a period of non-drinking and blog about their experiences. The purpose of this paper is to explore how HSM members negotiated their periods of abstention, with a focus on how not drinking influenced their narratives of selfhood.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), StringElement('Thematic analysis was undertaken of 2844 blog posts from 154 Victorians who signed up to HSM in 2013 or 2014.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'METHODS', u'Label': u'METHODS'}), StringElement('Analysis revealed three key narratives of selfhood offered by participants: (1) abstinence resulting in a disrupted sense of self, (2) non-consumption facilitating the development of a new healthy self, and (3) anti-consumption facilitating the development of a resistant self.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'RESULTS', u'Label': u'RESULTS'}), StringElement('Individuals construct and maintain their sense of self through consumption (or non-consumption) activities, and this occurs within the broader context of the relationship between selfhood, consumption and culture. HSM members developed narratives of self by drawing on a range of wider discursive structures concerning pleasure, healthism and resistance. The typologies of non-drinking selves identified in this paper could be disseminated through platforms such as HSM to support people who are new to non-drinking in choosing how they might construct and enact alternative selfhoods in contexts where alcohol consumption is deeply embedded.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'CONCLUSIONS', u'Label': u'CONCLUSION'})]
