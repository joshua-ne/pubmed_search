Hello Sunday Morning.
Health (London, England : 1997)
["Hello Sunday Morning is an online health promotion organisation that began in 2009.
Hello Sunday Morning asks participants to stop consuming alcohol for a period of time, set a goal and document their progress on a personal blog.
Hello Sunday Morning is a unique health intervention for three interrelated reasons: (1) it was generated outside a clinical setting, (2) it uses new media technologies to create structured forms of participation in an iterative and open-ended way and (3) participants generate a written record of their progress along with demographic, behavioural and engagement data.
This article presents a text analysis of the blog posts of Hello
Sunday Morning participants using the software program Leximancer.
Analysis of blogs illustrates how participants' expressions change over time.
In the first month, participants tended to set goals, describe their current drinking practices in individual and cultural terms, express hopes and anxieties and report on early efforts to change.
After month 1, participants continued to report on efforts to change and associated challenges and reflect on their place as individuals in a drinking culture.
In addition to this, participants evaluated their efforts to change and presented their 'findings' and 'theorised' them to provide advice for others.
We contextualise this text analysis with respect to Hello Sunday Morning's development of more structured forms of online participation.
We offer a critical appraisal of the value of text analytics in the development of online health interventions."] 
26656348 Currently the full-text not available Significant Improvement of Puncture Accuracy and Fluoroscopy Reduction in Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy With Novel Lumbar Location System: Preliminary Report of Prospective Hello Study.
Medicine [u"Prospective nonrandomized control study.
The study aimed to investigate the implication of the HE's Lumbar LOcation (HELLO) system in improving the puncture accuracy and reducing fluoroscopy in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED).Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy is one of the most popular minimally invasive spine surgeries that heavily depend on repeated fluoroscopy.
Increased fluoroscopy will induce higher radiation exposure to surgeons and patients.
Accurate puncture in PTED can be achieved by accurate preoperative location and definite trajectory.
The HELLO system mainly consists of self-made surface locator and puncture-assisted device.
The surface locator was used to identify the exact puncture target and the puncture-assisted device was used to optimize the puncture trajectory.
Patients who had single L4/5 or L5/S1 lumbar intervertebral disc herniation and underwent PTED were included the study.
Patients receiving the HELLO system were assigned in Group A, and those taking conventional method were assigned in Group B. Study primary endpoint was puncture times and fluoroscopic times, and the secondary endpoint was location time and operation time.
A total of 62 patients who received PTED were included in this study.
The average age was 45.35\u200a\xb1\u200a8.70 years in Group A and 46.61\u200a\xb1\u200a7.84 years in Group B (P\u200a=\u200a0.552).
There were no significant differences in gender, body mass index, conservative time, and surgical segment between the 2 groups (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).
The puncture times were 1.19\u200a\xb1\u200a0.48 in Group A and 6.03\u200a\xb1\u200a1.87 in Group B (P\u200a<\u200a0.001).
The fluoroscopic times were 14.03\u200a\xb1\u200a2.54 in Group A and 25.19\u200a\xb1\u200a4.28 in Group B (P\u200a<\u200a0.001).
The preoperative location time was 4.67\u200a\xb1\u200a1.41\u200aminutes in Group A and 6.98\u200a\xb1\u200a0.94\u200aminutes in Group B (P\u200a<\u200a0.001).
The operation time was 79.42\u200a\xb1\u200a10.15\u200aminutes in Group A and 89.65\u200a\xb1\u200a14.06\u200aminutes in Group B (P\u200a=\u200a0.002).
The hospital stay was 2.77\u200a\xb1\u200a0.95 days in Group A and 2.87\u200a\xb1\u200a1.02 days in Group B (P\u200a=\u200a0.702).
There were no significant differences in the complication rate between the 2 groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.386).The highlight of HELLO system is accurate preoperative location and definite trajectory.
This preliminary report indicated that the HELLO system significantly improves the puncture accuracy of PTED and reduces the fluoroscopic times, preoperative location time, as well as operation time.
