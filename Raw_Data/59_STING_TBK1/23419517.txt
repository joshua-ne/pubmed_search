23419517 DNA sensing unchained. ['In two recent reports in Science, James Chen and colleagues provide compelling evidence that detection of cytosolic DNA triggers the production of a novel second messenger, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which in turn activates a signaling pathway that induces type I interferons (IFNs) in a STING-dependent manner. They further unravel a key role for a so far uncharacterized murine protein E330016A19 (human homolog: C6ORF150), now termed cGAMP synthetase (cGAS), to act as the DNA sensor that generates cGAMP.']
