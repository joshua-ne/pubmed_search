25299331 The ER-associated protein ZDHHC1 is a positive regulator of DNA virus-triggered, MITA/STING-dependent innate immune signaling. ['Viral DNA sensing within the cytosol of infected cells activates type I interferon (IFN) expression. MITA/STING plays an essential role in this pathway by acting as both a sensor for the second messenger cGAMP and as an adaptor for downstream signaling components. In an expression screen for proteins that can activate the IFNB1 promoter, we identified the ER-associated protein ZDHHC1 as a positive regulator of virus-triggered, MITA/STING-dependent immune signaling. Zdhhc1(-/-) cells failed to effectively produce IFNs and other cytokines in response to infection with DNA but not RNA viruses. Zdhhc1(-/-) mice infected with the neurotropic DNA virus HSV-1 exhibited lower cytokine levels and higher virus titers in the brain, resulting in higher lethality. ZDHHC1 constitutively associated with MITA/STING and mediates dimerization/aggregation of MITA/STING and recruitment of the downstream signaling components TBK1 and IRF3. These findings support a role for ZDHHC1 in mediating MITA/STING-dependent innate immune response against DNA viruses.']
