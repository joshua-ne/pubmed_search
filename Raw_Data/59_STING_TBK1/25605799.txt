25605799 A KALA-modified lipid nanoparticle containing CpG-free plasmid DNA as a potential DNA vaccine carrier for antigen presentation and as an immune-stimulative adjuvant. ['Technologies that delivery antigen-encoded plasmid DNA (pDNA) to antigen presenting cell and their immune-activation are required for the success of DNA vaccines. Here we report on an artificial nanoparticle that can achieve these; a multifunctional envelope-type nanodevice modified with KALA, a peptide that forms α-helical structure at physiological pH (KALA-MEND). KALA modification and the removal of the CpG-motifs from the pDNA synergistically boosted transfection efficacy. In parallel, transfection with the KALA-MEND enhances the production of multiple cytokines and chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules via the Toll-like receptor 9-independent manner. Endosome-fusogenic lipid envelops and a long length of pDNA are essential for this immune stimulation. Furthermore, cytoplasmic dsDNA sensors that are related to the STING/TBK1 pathway and inflammasome are involved in IFN-β and IL-1β production, respectively. Consequently, the robust induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphoma activity and the resulting prophylactic and therapeutic anti-tumor effect was observed in mice that had been immunized with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ex vivo transfected with antigen-encoding pDNA. Collectively, the KALA-MEND possesses dual functions; gene transfection system and immune-stimulative adjuvant, those are both necessary for the successful DNA vaccine.']
