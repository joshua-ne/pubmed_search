25385820 STING-mediated DNA sensing promotes antitumor and autoimmune responses to dying cells. ['Adaptive immune responses to Ags released by dying cells play a critical role in the development of autoimmunity, allograft rejection, and spontaneous as well as therapy-induced tumor rejection. Although cell death in these situations is considered sterile, various reports have implicated type I IFNs as drivers of the ensuing adaptive immune response to cell-associated Ags. However, the mechanisms that underpin this type I IFN production are poorly defined. In this article, we show that dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake and sense nuclear DNA-associated entities released by dying cells to induce type I IFN. Remarkably, this molecular pathway requires STING, but not TLR or NLR function, and results in the activation of IRF3 in a TBK1-dependent manner. DCs are shown to depend on STING function in vivo to efficiently prime IFN-dependent CD8(+) T cell responses to tumor Ags. Furthermore, loss of STING activity in DCs impairs the generation of follicular Th cells and plasma cells, as well as anti-nuclear Abs, in an inducible model of systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings suggest that the STING pathway could be manipulated to enable the rational design of immunotherapies that enhance or diminish antitumor and autoimmune responses, respectively.']
