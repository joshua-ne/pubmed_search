27742471 Yersinia YopJ negatively regulates IRF3-mediated antibacterial response through disruption of STING-mediated cytosolic DNA signaling. [StringElement('The Yersinia outer protein J (YopJ) plays a pivotal role in evading the host immune response and establishes a persistent infection in host cells after bacterial infection. YopJ is a cysteine protease and can act as a deubiquitinating enzyme that deubiquitinates several targets in multiple signaling pathways. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a critical adapter for the induction of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent production of the cytokines in response to nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. Our studies demonstrate that YopJ targets STING to inhibit IRF3 signaling. Specially, YopJ interacts with STING to block its ER-to-Golgi traffic and remove its K63-linked ubiquitination chains. Deubiquited STING perturbs the formation of STING-TBK1 complex and the activation of IRF3. The 172th cysteine of YopJ mediated STING deubiquitination and IRF3 signaling inhibition. Consequently, mice infected with WT and ΔYopJ/YopJ bacteria induced lower levels of IRF3 and IFN-β, decreased inflammation and reduced staining of STING as compared to ΔYopJ and ΔYopJ/YopJ C172A strains infection. The data herein reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which YopJ modulates innate immune signaling.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'UNASSIGNED'})]
