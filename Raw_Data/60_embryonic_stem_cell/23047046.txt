23047046 Simple methods for generating neural, bone and endodermal cell types from chick embryonic stem cells. ['Most work on embryonic stem cell differentiation uses mammalian cells derived from the blastocyst stage and some of the most widely used protocols to induce differentiation involve growing these cells in monolayer culture. Equivalent stem cells can be obtained from embryos of non-mammalian vertebrates, but to date this has only been successful in birds. These cells can contribute to all somatic lineages in chimaeras and can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell types in vitro via embryoid body formation. However to date there are no reliable methods for differentiating them into descendants from each of the germ layers in monolayer culture, comparable to the protocols used in mammals. Here we describe three simple and reproducible protocols for differentiation of chick embryonic stem cells into mesoderm (bone), endoderm and neuroectoderm (neurons and glia) in monolayer culture. These methods open the way for more direct comparisons of the properties of mammalian and avian embryonic stem cells that may highlight similarities and differences.']
