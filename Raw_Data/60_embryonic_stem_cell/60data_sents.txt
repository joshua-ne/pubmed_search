26371343 Generation of Self-Renewing Hepatoblasts From Human Embryonic Stem Cells by Chemical Approaches.
[StringElement('Somatic stem cells play crucial roles in organogenesis and tissue homeostasis and regeneration and may ultimately prove useful for cell therapy for a variety of degenerative diseases and injuries; however, isolation and expansion of most types of somatic stem cells from tissues are technically challenging.
Human pluripotent stem cells are a renewable source for any adult cell types, including somatic stem cells.
Generation of somatic stem cells from human pluripotent stem cells is a promising strategy to get these therapeutically valuable cells.
Previously, we developed a chemically defined condition for mouse hepatoblast self-renewal through a reiterative screening strategy.
In the present study, we efficiently generated hepatoblasts from human embryonic stem cells by a stepwise induction strategy.
Importantly, these human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatoblasts can be captured and stably maintained using conditions previously established for mouse hepatoblast self-renewal, which includes basal media supplemented with insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite, epidermal growth factor, glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor, transforming growth factor β receptor inhibitor, lysophosphatidic acid, and sphingosine 1-phosphate.
The cells can stably retain hepatoblast phenotypes during prolonged culture and can differentiate into mature hepatocytes through in vitro provision of hepatocyte lineage developmental cues.
After being embedded into three-dimensional Matrigel, these cells efficiently formed bile duct-like structures resembling native bile duct tissues.
These human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatoblasts would be useful as a renewable source for cell therapy of liver diseases.'

25820869 CXCR4 positive cell-derived Pdx1-high/Shh-low cells originated from embryonic stem cells improve the repair of pancreatic injury in mice.
['Treatments for pancreatic injuries have been significantly improved recently, but full recovery of pancreatic function remains difficult.
Embryonic stem cells have great potentialities for self-renewal and multiple differentiations.
In this study, we explored an approach to induce the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells in vitro.
Male mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured by the hanging-drop method to form embryoid bodies.
The definitive endoderm marked by CXCR4 in embryoid bodies was sorted by magnetic activated cell sorting and subsequently administrated with b-FGF, exendin-4, and cyclopamine to induce the differentiation of putative pancreatic progenitor cells, which was monitored by Pdx1, and Shh expressions.
The putative pancreatic progenitor cells were transplanted into female BALB/c mice with pancreatitis induced by L-Arginine.
Male donor cells were located by detecting sex-determining region of Y-chromosome DNA. Definitive endoderm cells (CXCR4(+) cells) were sorted from 5-day embryoid bodies.
After 3-day administration with b-FGF, exendin-4, and cyclopamine, Pdx1-high/Shh-low cells were differentiated from CXCR4(+) cells.
These cells developed into more amylase-secreted cells in vitro and could specifically reside in the damaged pancreas acinar area in mice with acute pancreatitis to enhance the regeneration.

26940741 High glucose suppresses embryonic stem cell differentiation into neural lineage cells.
['Abnormal neurogenesis occurs during embryonic development in human diabetic pregnancies and in animal models of diabetic embryopathy.
Our previous studies in a mouse model of diabetic embryopathy have implicated that high glucose of maternal diabetes delays neurogenesis in the developing neuroepithelium leading to neural tube defects.
However, the underlying process in high glucose-impaired neurogenesis is uncharacterized.
Neurogenesis from embryonic stem (ES) cells provides a valuable model for understanding the abnormal neural lineage development under high glucose conditions.
ES cells are commonly generated and maintained in high glucose (approximately 25\xa0mM glucose).
Here, the mouse ES cell line, E14, was gradually adapted to and maintained in low glucose (5\xa0mM), and became a glucose responsive E14 (GR-E14) line.
High glucose induced the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, CHOP, in GR-E14\xa0cells.
Under low glucose conditions, the GR-E14\xa0cells retained their pluripotency and capability to differentiate into neural lineage cells.
GR-E14\xa0cell differentiation into neural stem cells (Sox1 and nestin positive cells) was inhibited by high glucose.
Neuron (Tuj1 positive cells) and glia (GFAP positive cells) differentiation from GR-E14\xa0cells was also suppressed by high glucose.
In addition, high glucose delayed GR-E14 differentiation into neural crest cells by decreasing neural crest markers, paired box 3 (Pax3) and paired box 7 (Pax7).
Thus, high glucose impairs ES cell differentiation into neural lineage cells.
The low glucose adapted and high glucose responsive GR-E14\xa0cell line is a useful in\xa0vitro model for assessing the adverse effect of high glucose on the development of the central nervous system.'] 

26184691 Single Cell Analysis
Reveals Concomitant Transcription of Pluripotent and Lineage Markers
During the Early Steps of Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells.
['The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is associated with extensive changes in gene expression.
It is not yet clear whether these changes are the result of binary switch-like mechanisms or that of continuous and progressive variation.
Here, I have used immunostaining and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess changes in the expression of the well-known pluripotency-associated gene Pou5f1 (also known as Oct4) and early differentiation markers Sox1 and T-brachyury in single cells during the early steps of differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
I found extensive overlap between the expression of Pou5f1/Sox1 or Pou5f1/T-brachyury shortly after the initiation of differentiation towards either the neuronal or the mesendodermal lineage, but no evidence of correlation between their respective expression levels.
Quantitative analysis of transcriptional output at the sites of nascent transcription revealed that Pou5f1 and Sox1 were transcribed in pulses and that embryonic stem cell differentiation was accompanied by changes in pulsing frequencies.
The progressive induction of Sox1 was further associated with an increase in the average size of individual transcriptional bursts.
Surprisingly, single cells that actively and simultaneously transcribe both the pluripotency- and the lineage-associated genes could easily be found in the differentiating population.
The results presented here show for the first time that lineage priming can occur in cells that are actively transcribing a pluripotent marker.
Furthermore, they suggest that this process is associated with changes in transcriptional dynamics.'] 

24239964 Efficient definitive endoderm induction from mouse embryonic stem cell adherent cultures: a rapid screening model for differentiation studies.
['Definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) monolayer cultures has been limited by poor cell survival or low efficiency.
Recently, a combination of TGFβ and Wnt activation with BMP inhibition improved DE induction in embryoid bodies cultured in suspension.
Based on these observations we developed a protocol to efficiently induce DE cells in monolayer cultures of mESCs.
We obtained a good cell yield with 54.92% DE induction as shown by Foxa2, Sox17, Cxcr4 and E-Cadherin expression.
These DE-cells could be further differentiated into posterior foregut and pancreatic phenotypes using a culture protocol initially developed for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation.
In addition, this mESC-derived DE gave rise to hepatocyte-like cells after exposure to BMP and FGF ligands.
Our data therefore indicate a substantial improvement of monolayer DE induction from mESCs and support the concept that differentiation conditions for mESC-derived DE are similar to those for hESCs.
As mESCs are easier to maintain and manipulate in culture compared to hESCs, and considering the shorter duration of embryonic development in the mouse, this method of efficient DE induction on monolayer will promote the development of new differentiation protocols to obtain DE-derivatives, like pancreatic beta-cells, for future use in cell replacement therapies.'] 

26445831 Derivation and Chondrogenic Commitment of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitors.
['The induction of human embryonic stem cells to a mesenchymal-like progenitor population constitutes a developmentally relevant approach for efficient directed differentiation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells to the chondrogenic lineage.
The initial enrichment of a hemangioblast intermediate has been shown to yield a replenishable population of highly purified progenitor cells that exhibit the typical mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) surface markers as well as the capacity for multilineage differentiation to bone, fat, and cartilage.
Herein, we provide detailed methodologies for the derivation and characterization of potent mesenchymal-like progenitors from hES cells and describe in vitro assays for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-mediated differentiation to the chondrogenic lineage.'] 

24845830 The epigenetic bivalency of core pancreatic β-cell transcription factor genes within mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells is not affected by knockdown of the polycomb repressive complex 2, SUZ12.
['This study assesses changes in activator and repressor modifications to histones associated with the core transcription factor genes most highly upregulated or downregulated in pancreatic β-cells relative to expression in an embryonic stem cell line.
Epigenetic analysis of the Oct4, Utf1, Nanog and Sox2 (pluripotency) and Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2 and MafA (pancreatic β-cells) transcription factor genes in embryonic stem cells and a β-cell line (MIN6) showed the pluripotency genes were enriched for active (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 and histone 3 acetylated at lysine 9) and depleted of repressor modifications (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 9) around the transcription start site in mouse embryonic stem cells (D3), and this was reversed in MIN6 cells.
The β-cell transcription factors were bivalently enriched for activating (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4) and repressor
(histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27)
modifications in embryonic stem cells but were monovalent for the activator modification (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4) in the β-cells.
The polycomb repressor complex 2 acts as a histone 3 lysine 27 methylase and an essential component of this complex, SUZ12, was enriched at the β-cell transcription factors in embryonic stem cells and was reduced MIN6.
Knock-down of SUZ12 in embryonic stem cells, however, did not reduce the level of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 at β-cell transcription factor loci or break the transcriptional repression of these genes in embryonic stem cells.
This study shows the reduction in the total SUZ12 level was not a sufficient cause of the resolution of the epigenetic bivalency of β-cell transcription factors in embryonic stem cells.'] 

24616439 Antibody approaches to prepare clinically transplantable cells from human embryonic stem cells: identification of human embryonic stem cell surface markers by monoclonal antibodies.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are unique cell populations, possessing both unlimited self-renewal capacity and pluripotency, i.e. the potential to give rise to all kinds of specialized cells in the human body.
Marker molecules expressed on the surface of hESCs are important for the identification, characterization, and clinical application of hESCs.
Compared with conventional genomics- or proteomics-based approaches, generating monoclonal antibody (mAb) libraries against hESCs using alternative methodologies expands the repertoire of mAbs raised against non-protein markers, for example, glycolipid antigens.
Additional information about the conformation and post-translational modification of surface molecules can also be obtained.
In this article, we review how mAb libraries against hESC surface markers have been developed using whole-cell and decoy immunization strategies.'] 

25089837 Dynamic changes in energy metabolism upon embryonic stem cell differentiation support developmental toxicant identification.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are widely used to study embryonic development and to identify developmental toxicants.
Particularly, the embryonic stem cell test (EST) is well known as in vitro model to identify developmental toxicants.
Although it is clear that energy metabolism plays a crucial role in embryonic development, the modulation of energy metabolism in in vitro models, such as the EST, is not yet described.
The present study is among the first studies that analyses whole genome expression data to specifically characterize metabolic changes upon ESC early differentiation.
Our transcriptomic analyses showed activation of glycolysis, truncated activation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, activation of lipid synthesis, as well as activation of glutaminolysis during the early phase of ESC differentiation.
Taken together, this energy metabolism profile points towards energy metabolism reprogramming in the provision of metabolites for biosynthesis of cellular constituents.
Next, we defined a gene set that describes this energy metabolism profile.
We showed that this gene set could be successfully applied in the EST to identify developmental toxicants known to modulate cellular biosynthesis (5-fluorouracil and methoxyacetic acid), while other developmental toxicants or the negative control did not modulate the expression of this gene set.
Our description of dynamic changes in energy metabolism during early ESC differentiation, as well as specific identification of developmental toxicants
modulating energy metabolism, is an important step forward in the definition of the applicability domain of the EST.'] 

26006729 Thalidomide induced early gene expression perturbations indicative of human embryopathy in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Developmental toxicity testing has traditionally relied on animal models which are costly, time consuming, and require the sacrifice of large numbers of animals.
In addition, there are significant disparities between human beings and animals in their responses to chemicals.
Thalidomide is a species-specific developmental toxicant that causes severe limb malformations in humans but not in mice.
Here, we used microarrays to study transcriptomic changes induced by thalidomide in an in vitro model based on differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
C57BL/6 mESCs were allowed to differentiate spontaneously and RNA was collected at 24, 48, and 72h after exposure to 0.25mM thalidomide.
Global gene expression analysis using microarrays revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes upon thalidomide exposure that were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms and canonical pathways associated with embryonic development and differentiation.
In addition, many genes were found to be involved in small GTPases-mediated signal transduction, heart development, and inflammatory responses, which coincide with clinical evidences and may represent critical embryotoxicities of thalidomide.
These results demonstrate that transcriptomics in combination with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation is a promising alternative model for developmental toxicity assessment.']

25267362 Mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cells reveal niches that support neuronal differentiation in the adult rat brain.
['A neurogenic niche can be identified by the proliferation and differentiation of its naturally residing neural stem cells.
However, it remains unclear whether "silent" neurogenic niches or regions suitable for neural differentiation, other than the areas of active neurogenesis, exist in the adult brain.
Embryoid body (EB) cells derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are endowed with a high potential to respond to specification and neuralization signals of the embryo.
Hence, to identify microenvironments in the postnatal and adult rat brain with the capacity to support neuronal differentiation, we transplanted dissociated EB cells to conventional neurogenic and non-neurogenic regions.
Our results show a neuronal differentiation pattern of EB cells that was dependent on the host region.
Efficient neuronal differentiation of EB cells occurred within an adjacent region to the rostral migratory stream.
EB cell differentiation was initially patchy and progressed toward an even distribution along the graft by 15-21 days post-transplantation, giving rise mostly to GABAergic neurons.
EB cells in the striatum displayed a lower level of neuronal differentiation and derived into a significant number of astrocytes.
Remarkably, when EB cells were transplanted to the striatum of adult rats after a local ischemic stroke, increased number of neuroblasts and neurons were observed.
Unexpectedly, we determined that the adult substantia nigra pars compacta, considered a non-neurogenic area, harbors a robust neurogenic environment.
Therefore, neurally uncommitted cells derived from ESCs can detect regions that support neuronal differentiation within the adult brain, a fundamental step for the development of stem cell-based replacement therapies.'] 

24123724 Expression of embryonic stem cell markers and osteogenic differentiation potential in cells derived from periodontal granulation tissue.
['The aim of this study was to identify if cells obtained from periodontal granulation tissue possess embryonic stem cell properties and osteogenic capacities in vitro.
Periodontal granulation tissue was removed from one furcation and one infrabony defect (FGTC/IGTC-furcation/infrabony defect derived granulation tissue cells) of six patients.
The extracted tissues were treated with collagenase/dispase solution, cultured and passaged twice, while a fraction of them was bacteriologically analyzed.
Upon reaching confluence, total RNA was extracted, followed by cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR analysis.
Gene expression levels of collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the embryonic stem cell markers Nanog, Oct-4, Rex-1 and Sox-2 were measured, calibrated against the housekeeping gene GAPDH.
Further, osteogenic differentiation was induced.
Mineralized matrix formation was confirmed by von Kossa staining, and ALP activity was measured colorimetrically.
The total bacterial load amounted to 9.4 ± 14.6 × 10(6)
counts/mg of tissue for IGTC, and 11.1 ± 6.1 × 10(6) \u2009counts/of tissue for FGTC.
Among the embryonic stem cell markers (FGTC/IGTC), Nanog was most highly expressed (3.48 ± 1.2/5.85 ± 5.7), followed by Oct-4 (1.79 ± 0.69/2.85 ± 2.5), Sox-2 (0.66 ± 0.3/1.26 ± 1.4) and Rex-1 (0.06 ± 0.0/0.04 ± 0.0).
The osteogenic differentiation process was positive in both FGTC and IGTC, judged by increased von Kossa staining, and elevated ALP activity and gene expression.

25197338 Human amniotic fluid stem cells support undifferentiated propagation and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cell without b-FGF in a density dependent manner.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent cells which can give rise to almost all adult cell lineages.
Culture system of hESCs is complex, requiring exogenous b-FGF and feeder cell layer.
Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only synthesize soluble cytokines or factors such as b-FGF, but also provide other mechanism which might play positive role on sustaining hESCs propagation and pluripotency.
Human amniotic fluid stem (AFS) cells, which share characteristics of both embryonic and adult stem cells, have been regarded as promising cells for regenerative medicine.
Taking advantage by AFS cells, we studied the ability of AFS cells in supporting undifferentiated propagation and pluripotency of Chinese population derived X-01 hESCs.
Human AF-type amniotic fluid stem cells (hAF-AFSCs) transcribed genes including Activin A, TGF-β1, Noggin and b-FGF, which involved in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of hESCs.
Compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), hAF-AFSCs secreted higher concentration of b-FGF which was important in hESCs culture (P < 0.05).
The hESCs were propagated more than 30 passages on hAF-AFSCs layer with exogenous b-FGF supplementation, keeping undifferentiated status.
While exogenous b-FGF was obviated, propagation of hESCs with undifferentiated status was dependent on density of hAF-AFSC feeder layer.
Lower density of hAF-AFSCs resulted in rapid decline in undifferentiated clone number, while higher ones hindered the growth of colonies.
The most appropriate hAF-AFSCs feeder density to maintain the X-01 hESC line without exogenous b-FGF was 15-20×10(4)/well.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that hAF-AFSCs could support undifferentiated propagation and pluripotency of Chinese population derived hESCs without exogenous b-FGF supplementation.']

26102992 Enhanced therapeutic neovascularization by CD31-expressing cells and embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells engineered with chitosan hydrogel containing VEGF-releasing microtubes.
['Various stem cells and their progeny have been used therapeutically for vascular regeneration.
One of the major hurdles for cell-based therapy is low cell retention in\xa0vivo, and to improve cell survival several biomaterials have been used to encapsulate cells before transplantation.
Vascular regeneration involves new blood vessel formation which consists of two processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.
While embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived endothelial cells (ESC-ECs) have clearer vasculogenic potency, adult cells exert their effects mainly through paracrine angiogenic activities.
While these two cells have seemingly complementary advantages, there have not been any studies to date combining these two cell types for vascular regeneration.
We have developed a novel chitosan-based hydrogel construct that encapsulates both CD31-expressing BM-mononuclear cells (BM-CD31(+) cells) and ESC-ECs, and is loaded with VEGF-releasing microtubes.
This cell construct showed high cell survival and minimal cytotoxicity in\xa0vitro.
When implanted into a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, it induced robust cell retention, neovascularization through vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and efficiently induced recovery of blood flow in ischemic hindlimbs.

24605024 Embryonic stem cell factors and pancreatic cancer.
['Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic tumor, is a highly aggressive human cancer with the lowest five-year survival rate of any human maligancy primarily due to its early- metastasis and lack of response to chemotherapy and radiation.
Recent research suggests that PDAC cells comprise a hierarchy of tumor cells that develop around a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small and distinct population of cancer cells that mediates tumoregenesis, metastasis and resistance to standard treatments.
Thus, CSCs could be a target for more effective treatment options.
Interestingly, pancreatic CSCs are subject to regulation by some of key embryonic stem cell (ESC) transctiption factors abberently expressed in PDAC, such as SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG. ESC transcription factors are important DNA-binding proteins present in both embryonic and adult somatic cells.
The critical role of these factors in reprogramming processes makes them essential not only for embryonic development but also tumorigenesis.
Here we provide an overview of stem cell transcription factors, particularly SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG, on their expression and function in pancreatic cancer.
In contrast to embryonic stem cells, in which OCT4 and SOX2 are tightly regulated and physically interact to regulate a wide spectrum of target genes, de novo SOX2 expression alone in pancreatic cancer cells is sufficient to promote self-renewal, de-differentiation and imparting stemness characteristics via impacting specific cell cycle regulatory genes and epithelial-mesnechymal transtion driver genes.
Thus, targeting ESC factors, particularly SOX2, could be a worthy strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.']

24736402 Cobalt protoporphyrin pretreatment protects human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in vitro and increases graft size and vascularization in vivo.
['Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) can regenerate infarcted myocardium.
However, when implanted into acutely infarcted hearts, few cells survive the first week postimplant.
To improve early graft survival, hESC-CMs were pretreated with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a transcriptional activator of cytoprotective heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).
When hESC-CMs were challenged with an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, mimicking cell transplantation into an ischemic site, survival was significantly greater among cells pretreated with CoPP versus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-pretreated controls.
Compared with PBS-pretreated cells, CoPP-pretreated hESC-CM preparations exhibited higher levels of HO-1 expression, Akt phosphorylation, and vascular endothelial growth factor production, with reduced apoptosis, and a 30% decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species.
For in vivo translation, 1 × 10(7)
hESC-CMs were pretreated ex vivo with CoPP or PBS and then injected intramyocardially into rat hearts immediately following acute infarction (permanent coronary ligation).
At 1 week, hESC-CM content, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for human Alu sequences, was 17-fold higher in hearts receiving CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells.
On histomorphometry, cardiomyocyte graft size was 2.6-fold larger in hearts receiving CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells, occupying up to 12% of the ventricular area.
Vascular density of host-perfused human-derived capillaries was significantly greater in grafts composed of CoPP- than PBS-pretreated cells.
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that ex vivo pretreatment of hESC-CMs with a single dose of CoPP before intramyocardial implantation more than doubled resulting graft size and improved early graft vascularization in acutely infarcted hearts.
These findings open the door for delivery of these, or other, stem cells during acute interventional therapy following myocardial infarction or ischemia.']

In vitro human embryonic stem cell hematopoiesis mimics MYB-independent yolk sac hematopoiesis.
['Although hematopoietic precursor activity can be generated in vitro from human embryonic stem cells, there is no solid evidence for the appearance of multipotent, self-renewing and transplantable hematopoietic stem cells.
This could be due to short half-life of hematopoietic stem cells in culture or, alternatively, human embryonic stem cell-initiated hematopoiesis may be hematopoietic stem cell-independent, similar to yolk sac hematopoiesis, generating multipotent progenitors with limited expansion capacity.
Since a MYB was reported to be an excellent marker for hematopoietic stem cell-dependent hematopoiesis, we generated a MYB-eGFP reporter human embryonic stem cell line to study formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro.
We found CD34(+) hemogenic endothelial cells rounding up and developing into CD43(+) hematopoietic cells without expression of MYB-eGFP. MYB-eGFP(+) cells appeared relatively late in embryoid body cultures as CD34(+)CD43(+)CD45(-/lo) cells.
These MYB-eGFP(+) cells were CD33 positive, proliferated in IL-3 containing media and hematopoietic differentiation was restricted to the granulocytic lineage.
In agreement with data obtained on murine Myb(-/-) embryonic stem cells, bright eGFP expression was observed in a subpopulation of cells, during directed myeloid differentiation, which again belonged to the granulocytic lineage.
In contrast, CD14(+)

We determined that treatment with ferumoxytol at 300 μg/ml on day 0 of cardiac differentiation offered adequate cell viability and signal intensity for MRI detection without compromising further differentiation into definitive cardiac lineages.
Labeled hESC-CPCs were transplanted by open surgical methods into the left ventricular free wall of uninjured pig hearts and imaged both ex vivo and in vivo.
Comprehensive T2*-weighted images were obtained immediately after transplantation and 40 days later before termination.
The localization and dispersion of labeled cells could be effectively imaged and tracked at days 0 and 40 by MRI.
Thus, under the described conditions, ferumoxytol can be used as a long-term, differentiation-neutral cell-labeling agent to track transplanted hESC-CPCs in vivo using MRI.', attributes={'Label': 'UNLABELLED'}), StringElement('The development of a safe and reproducible in vivo imaging technique to track the fate of transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hESC-CPCs) is a necessary step to clinical translation.

26285657 Targeted Disruption of the β2-Microglobulin Gene Minimizes the Immunogenicity of Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
[StringElement('Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of cells for tissue regeneration, yet histoincompatibility remains a major challenge to their clinical application.
Because the human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules are the primary mediators of immune rejection, we hypothesized that cells derived from a hESC line lacking HLA-I expression could be transplanted without evoking a robust immune response from allogeneic recipients.
In the present study, we used the replacement targeting strategy to delete exons 2 and 3 of β2-microglobulin on both gene alleles in hESCs.
Because β2-microglobulin serves as the HLA-I light chain, disruption of the β2-microglobulin gene led to complete HLA-I deficiency on the cell surface of hESCs and their derivatives.
Therefore, these cells were resistant to CD8+ T-cell-mediated destruction.
Although interferon-γ (IFN-γ) treatment significantly induced β2-microglobulin expression, promoting CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of control hESCs and their derivatives, CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was barely observed with β2-microglobulin-null hESCs and their derivatives treated with IFN-γ.
This genetic manipulation to disrupt HLA-I expression did not affect the self-renewal capacity, genomic stability, or pluripotency of hESCs.
Despite being relatively sensitive to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing due to the lack of HLA-I expression, when transplanted into NK cell-depleted immunocompetent mice, β2-microglobulin-null hESCs developed into tumors resembling those derived from control hESCs in severe combined immunodeficiency mice.

23255130 Diploid, but not haploid, human embryonic stem cells can be derived from microsurgically repaired tripronuclear human zygotes.
['Human embryonic stem cells have shown tremendous potential in regenerative medicine, and the recent progress in haploid embryonic stem cells provides new insights for future applications of embryonic stem cells.
Disruption of normal fertilized embryos remains controversial; thus, the development of a new source for human embryonic stem cells is important for their usefulness.
Here, we investigated the feasibility of haploid and diploid embryo reconstruction and embryonic stem cell derivation using microsurgically repaired tripronuclear human zygotes.
Diploid and haploid zygotes were successfully reconstructed, but a large proportion of them still had a tripolar spindle assembly.
The reconstructed embryos developed to the blastocyst stage, although the loss of chromosomes was observed in these zygotes.
Finally, triploid and diploid human embryonic stem cells were derived from tripronuclear and reconstructed zygotes (from which only one pronucleus was removed), but haploid human embryonic stem cells were not successfully derived from the reconstructed zygotes when two pronuclei were removed.
Both triploid and diploid human embryonic stem cells showed the general characteristics of human embryonic stem cells.
These results indicate that the lower embryo quality resulting from abnormal spindle assembly contributed to the failure of the haploid embryonic stem cell derivation.
However, the successful derivation of diploid embryonic stem cells demonstrated that microsurgical tripronuclear zygotes are an alternative source of human embryonic stem cells.
In the future, improving spindle assembly will facilitate the application of triploid zygotes to the field of haploid embryonic stem cells.'] 

23612295 Max is a repressor of germ cell-related gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs) express many pluripotency-associated genes, but embryonic stem cells do not normally undergo conversion into primordial germ cells.
Thus, we predicted that there is a mechanism that represses primordial germ cell-related gene expression in embryonic stem cells.
Here we identify genes involved in this putative mechanism, by using an embryonic stem cell line with a Vasa reporter in an RNA interference screen of transcription factor genes expressed in embryonic stem cells.
We identify five genes that result in the expression of Vasa when silenced.
Of these, Max is the most striking.
Transcriptome analysis reveals that Max knockdown in embryonic stem cells results in selective, global derepression of germ cell-specific genes.
Max interacts with histone H3K9 methyltransferases and associates with the germ cell-specific genes in embryonic stem cells.
In addition, Max knockdown results in a decrease in histone H3K9 dimethylation at their promoter regions.
We propose that Max is part of protein complex that acts as a repressor of germ cell-related genes in embryonic stem cells.'] 

25894570 Interleukin-1β-induced autophagy-related gene 5 regulates proliferation of embryonic stem cell-derived odontoblastic cells.
['We previously established a method for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells into α2 integrin-positive odontoblast-like cells.
We also reported that Wnt5 in response to interleukin (IL)-1β induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3-regulated cell proliferation in these cells.
Our findings suggest that MMP-3 plays a potentially unique physiological role in the generation of odontoblast-like cells under an inflammatory state.
Here, we examined whether up-regulation of autophagy-related gene (Atg) 5 by IL-1β was mediated by Wnt5 signaling, thus leading to increased proliferation of odontoblast-like cells.
IL-1β increased the mRNA and protein levels of Atg5, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3, a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8) and Atg12.
Treatment with siRNAs against Atg5, but not LC3 and Atg12, suppressed the IL-1β-induced increase in MMP-3 expression and cell proliferation.
Our siRNA analyses combined with western blot analysis revealed a unique sequential cascade involving Atg5, Wnt5a and MMP-3, which resulted in the potent increase in odontoblastic cell proliferation.
These results demonstrate the unique involvement of Atg5 in IL-1β-induced proliferation of embryonic stem cell-derived odontoblast-like cells.'] 

24786547 A screen of suitable inducers for germline differentiation of chicken embryonic stem cells.
['Differentiation of germ cells from embryonic stem cells in vitro could have great application for treating infertility and provide an excellent model for uncovering molecular mechanisms of germline generation.
In this study, we aim to screen the suitable inducers that may prove the efficiency of driving chicken embryonic stem cells (ES cells) toward germ cells.
The male ES cells were separeted into different groups: single retinoic acid (RA) treatment, co-cultured with sertoli cell feeder with RA induction, cultured on matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin and collagen) with RA treatment, cultured on fibronectin with sertoli cell feeder and RA induction, and single bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) treatment.
Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoourescence were performed to characterize the ES cells differentiation process.
The results showed that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)-like were not detected in single RA and RA with collagen groups, but were observed in the other groups.
The expression of ES specific genes (Nanog and Sox2) was decreased while SSCs marker genes (Dazl, Stra8, integrin α6, integrinβ1 and C-kit) was remarkably increased.
The multiple comparsion results showed that the expression of SSCs marker genes in RA with sertoli cells group was significantly higher than the other groups(P<0.05).
Collectively, our results suggested that chicken ES cells possess the potency to differentiate into SSCs-like cells in vitro through RA, matrix proteins, sertoli cells and BMP4 induction, of which co-cultured with sertoli cell feeder with RA induction was proved to be the best.'] 

24674590 Role of retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor 2 in neural differentiation from cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) embryonic stem cells.
['Retinoic acid is a widely used factor in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells.
It suppresses differentiation to mesoderm and enhances differentiation to ectoderm.
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is widely used to induce differentiation to neurons in mice, yet in primates, including humans, it maintains embryonic stem cells in the undifferentiated state.
In this study, we established an FGF2 low-dose-dependent embryonic stem cell line from cynomolgus monkeys and then analyzed neural differentiation in cultures supplemented with retinoic acid and FGF2.
When only retinoic acid was added to culture, neurons differentiated from FGF2 low-dose-dependent embryonic stem cells.
When both retinoic acid and FGF2 were added, neurons and astrocytes differentiated from the same embryonic stem cell line.
Thus, retinoic acid promotes the differentiation from embryonic stem cells to neuroectoderm.
Although FGF2 seems to promote self-renewal in stem cells, its effects on the differentiation of stem cells are influenced by the presence or absence of supplemental retinoic acid.'] 

25497839 Enhanced expression of FNDC5 in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural cells along with relevant embryonic neural tissues.
['Availability of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has enhanced the capability of basic and clinical research in the context of human neural differentiation.
Derivation of neural progenitor (NP) cells from hESCs facilitates the process of human embryonic development through the generation of neuronal subtypes.
We have recently indicated that fibronectin type III domain containing 5 protein (FNDC5) expression is required for appropriate neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
Bioinformatics analyses have shown the presence of three isoforms for human FNDC5 mRNA. To differentiate which isoform of FNDC5 is involved in the process of human neural differentiation, we have used hESCs as an in vitro model for neural differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) induction.
The hESC line, Royan H5, was differentiated into a neural lineage in defined adherent culture treated by RA and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).
We collected all cell types that included hESCs, rosette structures, and neural cells in an attempt to assess the expression of FNDC5 isoforms.
There was a contiguous increase in all three FNDC5 isoforms during the neural differentiation process.
Furthermore, the highest level of expression of the isoforms was significantly observed in neural cells compared to hESCs and the rosette structures known as neural precursor cells (NPCs).
High expression levels of FNDC5 in human fetal brain and spinal cord tissues have suggested the involvement of this gene in neural tube development.
Additional research is necessary to determine the major function of FDNC5 in this process.']

['Retinoic acid (RA) and oleanolic acid (OA) were studied about their potential to induce mouse embryonic stem cell R1/E (MESC-R1/E) to differentiate toward germ cells.
Embryoid bodies (EBs) first formed from MESC-R1/E and EBs were allowed to attach to the bottoms of normal cell-culturing plate and grow.
Then, different compounds including RA, OA and so on were respectively added to induce MESC-R1/E to differentiate.
After 72\u2009h, microscopy images were taken for all interventions, then total RNAs were extracted, cDNAs were synthesized and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to detect the transcriptional expression patterns of 11 reproductive-differentiation-related genes for different compounds respectively.
During the data analysis, it was found RA significantly up-regulated the expression levels of GDF-9, Stra8, SCP3, Mvh, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, while significantly down-regulated the levels of Itag6 and Itgb1, and the level of Oct-4 was down-regulated insignificantly, while the level of TP2 was up-regulated insignificantly; OA significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Stra8, SCP3, Mvh, ZP1, ZP2, Itgb1, and TP2, and the levels of Oct-4, GDF-9, ZP3, and Itga6 were up-regulated insignificantly.

23871934 The self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells is regulated by cell-substratum adhesion and cell spreading.
['Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergo self-renewal in the presence of the cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF).
Following LIF withdrawal, mESCs differentiate, and this is accompanied by an increase in cell-substratum adhesion and cell spreading.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between cell spreading and mESC differentiation.
Using E14 and R1 mESC lines, we have restricted cell spreading in the absence of LIF by either culturing mESCs on chemically defined, weakly adhesive biomaterial substrates, or by manipulating the cytoskeleton.
We demonstrate that by restricting the degree of spreading by either method, mESCs can be maintained in an undifferentiated and pluripotent state.
Under these conditions, self-renewal occurs without the need for LIF and is independent of nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 or β-catenin, which have previously been implicated in self-renewal.
We also demonstrate that the effect of restricted cell spreading on mESC self-renewal is not mediated by increased intercellular adhesion, as evidenced by the observations that inhibition of mESC adhesion using a function blocking anti E-cadherin antibody or siRNA do not promote differentiation.
These results show that mESC spreading and differentiation are regulated both by LIF and by cell-substratum adhesion, consistent with the hypothesis that cell spreading is the common intermediate step in the regulation of mESC differentiation by either LIF or cell-substratum adhesion.'] 

26114724 Histone variants as emerging regulators of embryonic stem cell identity.
['Dynamic regulation of chromatin structure is an important mechanism for balancing the pluripotency and cell fate decision in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Indeed ESCs are characterized by unusual chromatin packaging, and a wide variety of chromatin regulators have been implicated in control of pluripotency and differentiation.
Genome-wide maps of epigenetic factors have revealed a unique epigenetic signature in pluripotent ESCs and have contributed models to explain their plasticity.
In addition to the well known epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA, histone variants are emerging as important regulators of ESC identity.
In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent progress that has highlighted the central role of histone variants in ESC pluripotency and ESC fate, focusing, in particular, on H1 variants, H2A variants H2A.X, H2A.Z and macroH2A and H3 variant H3.3.'] 

24939742 mRNA-Seq and microRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analyses of rhesus monkey embryonic stem cell neural differentiation revealed the potential regulators of rosette neural stem cells.
['Rosette neural stem cells (R-NSCs) represent early stage of neural development and possess full neural differentiation and regionalization capacities.
R-NSCs are considered as stem cells of neural lineage and have important implications in the study of neurogenesis and cell replacement therapy.
However, the molecules regulating their functional properties remain largely unknown.
Rhesus monkey is an ideal model to study human neural degenerative diseases and plays intermediate translational roles as therapeutic strategies evolved from rodent systems to human clinical applications.
In this study, we derived R-NSCs from rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and systematically investigated the unique expressions of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and signalling pathways by genome-wide comparison of the mRNA and miRNA profilings of ESCs, R-NSCs at early (R-NSCP1) and late (R-NSCP6) passages, and neural progenitor cells.
Apart from the R-NSCP1-specific protein-coding genes and miRNAs, we identified several pathways including Hedgehog and Wnt highly activated in R-NSCP1.
The possible regulatory interactions among the miRNAs, protein-coding genes, and signalling pathways were proposed.
Besides, many genes with alternative splicing switch were identified at R-NSCP1.
These data provided valuable resource to understand the regulation of early neurogenesis and to better manipulate the R-NSCs for cell replacement therapy.']

23630199 Geminin restrains mesendodermal fate acquisition of embryonic stem cells and is associated with antagonism of Wnt signaling and enhanced polycomb-mediated repression.
["Embryonic cells use both growth factor signaling and cell intrinsic transcriptional and epigenetic regulation to acquire early cell fates.
Underlying mechanisms that integrate these cues are poorly understood.
Here, we investigated the role of Geminin, a nucleoprotein that interacts with both transcription factors and epigenetic regulatory complexes, during fate acquisition of mouse embryonic stem cells.
In order to determine Geminin's role in mesendoderm formation, a process which occurs during embryonic gastrulation, we selectively over-expressed or knocked down Geminin in an in vitro model of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.
We found that Geminin antagonizes mesendodermal fate acquisition, while these cells instead maintain elevated expression of genes associated with pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.
During mesendodermal fate acquisition, Geminin knockdown promotes Wnt signaling, while Bmp, Fgf, and Nodal signaling are not affected.
Moreover, we showed that Geminin facilitates the repression of mesendodermal genes that are regulated by the Polycomb repressor complex.
Geminin directly binds several of these genes, while Geminin knockdown in mesendodermal cells reduces Polycomb repressor complex occupancy at these loci and increases trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, which correlates with active gene expression.
Together, these results indicate that Geminin is required to restrain mesendodermal fate acquisition of early embryonic cells and that this is associated with both decreased Wnt signaling and enhanced Polycomb repressor complex retention at mesendodermal genes."] 

25660408 In vivo repopulating activity emerges at the onset of hematopoietic specification during embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['The generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells from in vitro differentiating embryonic stem cells has remained a long-standing challenge.
To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors.
Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells in the absence of ectopically expressed factors.
We show that repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification.
We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu.
Our findings define the precise differentiating stage at which hematopoietic repopulating activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis.'] 

25204799 Divergence(s) in nodal signaling between aggressive melanoma and embryonic stem cells.
["The significant role of the embryonic morphogen Nodal in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells is well documented.
Interestingly, the recent discovery of Nodal's re-expression in several aggressive and metastatic cancers has highlighted its critical role in self renewal and maintenance of the stem cell-like characteristics of tumor cells, such as melanoma.
However, the key TGFβ/Nodal signaling component(s) governing Nodal's effects in metastatic melanoma remain mostly unknown.
By employing receptor profiling at the mRNA and protein level(s), we made the novel discovery that embryonic stem cells and metastatic melanoma cells share a similar repertoire of Type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, but diverge in their Type II receptor expression.
Ligand:receptor crosslinking and native gel binding assays indicate that metastatic melanoma cells employ the heterodimeric TGFβ receptor I/TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRI/TGFβRII) for signal transduction, whereas embryonic stem cells use the Activin receptors I and II (ACTRI/ACTRII).
This unexpected receptor usage by tumor cells was tested by: neutralizing antibody to block its function; and transfecting the dominant negative receptor to compete with the endogenous receptor for ligand binding.
Furthermore, a direct biological role for TGFβRII was found to underlie vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an endothelial phenotype contributing to vascular perfusion and associated with the functional plasticity of aggressive melanoma.
Collectively, these findings reveal the divergence in Nodal signaling between embryonic stem cells and metastatic melanoma that can impact new therapeutic strategies targeting the re-emergence of embryonic pathways."]

25524013 Distinct gene expression responses of two anticonvulsant drugs in a novel human embryonic stem cell based neural differentiation assay protocol.
['Hazard assessment of chemicals and pharmaceuticals is increasingly gaining from knowledge about molecular mechanisms of toxic action acquired in dedicated in vitro assays.
We have developed an efficient human embryonic stem cell neural differentiation test (hESTn) that allows the study of the molecular interaction of compounds with the neural differentiation process.
Within the 11-day differentiation protocol of the assay, embryonic stem cells lost their pluripotency, evidenced by the reduced expression of stem cell markers Pou5F1 and Nanog.
Moreover, stem cells differentiated into neural cells, with morphologically visible neural structures together with increased expression of neural differentiation-related genes such as βIII-tubulin, Map2, Neurogin1, Mapt and Reelin.
Valproic acid (VPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) exposure during hESTn differentiation led to concentration-dependent reduced expression of βIII-tubulin, Neurogin1 and Reelin.
In parallel VPA caused an increased gene expression of Map2 and Mapt which is possibly related to the neural protective effect of VPA.
These findings illustrate the added value of gene expression analysis for detecting compound specific effects in hESTn.
Our findings were in line with and could explain effects observed in animal studies.

Four weeks after transplantation, the grafted cells were found to be viable at the border of the necrosis and had differentiated into neurons.
Transplanted rats did not exhibit any behavioral improvement, because tumor formed in 90% of the animals.
Immunosuppression facilitated tumor formation.
Tumors were observed in 40% of normal rats after NPC transplantation when cyclosporin A was administered.
Meanwhile, no tumor formation was observed without cyclosporin A. Ischemic damage also facilitated tumor formation, because NPCs gave rise to tumors in 90% of ischemic rats, a percentage significantly higher than that in intact rats, which was 40%.

They exhibited a marker gene transcription profile different from that of ES cells and did not form tumors in transplanted nude mice.

Our results demonstrated that MP alone dose-dependently promoted the gene expression of chondrogenic and early osteogenic markers.
In combination with soluble osteoinductive cues, MPs enhanced the hypertrophic and osteogenic phenotype, and mineralization of ESC aggregates.
Additionally, MPs dose-dependently reduced ESC pluripotency and thereby decreased the size of teratomas derived from MP-incorporated ESC aggregates in vivo.

26456652 Altered calcium handling and increased contraction force in human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes following short term dexamethasone exposure.
['One limitation in using human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) for disease modeling and cardiac safety pharmacology is their immature functional phenotype compared with adult cardiomyocytes.
Here, we report that treatment of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, activated glucocorticoid signaling which in turn improved their calcium handling properties and contractility.
L-type calcium current and action potential properties were not affected by dexamethasone but significantly faster calcium decay, increased forces of contraction and sarcomeric lengths, were observed in hESC-CMs after dexamethasone exposure.
Activating the glucocorticoid pathway can thus contribute to mediating hPSC-CMs maturation.'] 

26586221 Selection and dynamics of embryonic stem cell integration into early mouse embryos.
['The process by which pluripotent cells incorporate into host embryos is of interest to investigate cell potency and cell fate decisions.
Previous studies suggest that only a minority of the embryonic stem cell (ESC)
inoculum contributes to the adult chimaera.
How incoming cells are chosen for integration or elimination remains unclear.
By comparing a heterogeneous mix of undifferentiated and differentiating ESCs (serum/LIF) with more homogeneous undifferentiated culture (2i/LIF), we examine the role of cellular heterogeneity in this process.
Time-lapse ex vivo imaging revealed a drastic elimination of serum/LIF ESCs during early development in comparison with 2i/LIF ESCs.
Using a fluorescent reporter for naive pluripotency (Rex1-GFP), we established that the acutely eliminated serum/LIF ESCs had started to differentiate.
The rejected cells were apparently killed by apoptosis.
We conclude that a selection process exists by which unwanted differentiating cells are eliminated from the embryo.
However, occasional Rex1(-) cells were able to integrate.
Upregulation of Rex1 occurred in a proportion of these cells, reflecting the potential of the embryonic environment to expedite diversion from differentiation priming to enhance the developing embryonic epiblast.'] 

25486050 The cellular form of the prion protein guides the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into neuron-, oligodendrocyte-, and astrocyte-committed lineages.
['Prion protein, PrP(C), is a glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface beginning with the early stages of embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Previously, we showed that ectopic expression of PrP(C) in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) triggered differentiation toward endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal lineages, whereas silencing of PrP(C) suppressed differentiation toward ectodermal but not endodermal or mesodermal lineages.
Considering that PrP(C) might be involved in controlling the balance between cells of different lineages, the current study was designed to test whether PrP(C) controls differentiation of hESCs into cells of neuron-, oligodendrocyte-, and astrocyte-committed lineages.
PrP(C) was silenced in hESCs cultured under three sets of conditions that were previously shown to induce hESCs differentiation into predominantly neuron-, oligodendrocyte-, and astrocyte-committed lineages.
We found that silencing of PrP(C) suppressed differentiation toward all three lineages.
Similar results were observed in all three protocols, arguing that the effect of PrP(C) was independent of differentiation conditions employed.
Moreover, switching PrP(C) expression during a differentiation time course revealed that silencing PrP(C) expression during the very initial stage that corresponds to embryonic bodies has a more significant impact than silencing at later stages of differentiation.
The current work illustrates that PrP(C) controls differentiation of hESCs toward neuron-, oligodendrocyte-, and astrocyte-committed lineages and is likely involved at the stage of uncommitted neural progenitor cells rather than lineage-committed neural progenitors.'] 

26631989 Histone modification profiling reveals differential signatures associated with human embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.
['In this study, we trace developmental stages using epigenome changes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) treated with drugs modulating either self-renewal or differentiation.
Based on microscopy, qPCR and flow cytometry, we classified the treatment outcome as inducing pluripotency (hESC, flurbiprofen and gatifloxacin), mesendoderm (sinomenine), differentiation (cyamarin, digoxin, digitoxin, selegeline and theanine) and lineage-commitment (RA).
When we analyzed histone PTMs that imprinted these gene and protein expressions, the above classification was reassorted.
Hyperacetylation at H3K4, 9, 14, 18, 56 and 122 as well as H4K5, 8, 12 and 16 emerged as the pluripotency signature of hESCs.
Methylations especially of H3 at K9, K20, K27 and K36 characterized differentiation initiation as seen in no-drug control and fluribiprofen.
Sinomenine-treated cells clustered close to "differentiation initiators", consistent with flow cytometry where it induced mesendoderm, along with cyamarin and possibly selegnine.
Neurectoderm, induced by RA and theanine manifested methylations on H3 shifts to H3.3.
By both flow cytometry and histone PTM clustering, it appears that cells treated with gatifloxacin, flurbiprofen, digitoxin and digoxin were not yet lineage-committed or mixed cell types.
Taken together, our moderate-throughput histone PTM profiling approach highlighted subtle epigenetic signatures that permitted us to predict divergent lineage progression even in differentiating cells with similar phenotype and gene expression.']

25947656 Generation of mouse chimeras with high contribution of tetraploid embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-fibroblast hybrid cells.
['The in vitro long-term cultivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from pre-implantation embryos offers the unique possibility of combining ES cells with pre-implantation embryos to generate chimeras, thus facilitating the creation of a bridge between in vitro and in vivo investigations.
Genomic manipulation using ES cells and homologous recombination is one of the most outstanding scientific achievements, resulting in the generation of animals with desirable genome modifications.
As such, the generation of ES cells with different ploidy via cell fusion also deserves much attention because this approach allows for the production of chimeras that contain somatic cells with various ploidy.

26299974 Murine embryonic stem cell line CGR8 expresses all subtypes of muscarinic receptors and multiple nicotinic receptor subunits: Down-regulation of α4- and β4-subunits during early differentiation.
['Non-neuronal acetylcholine mediates its cellular effects via stimulation of the G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors and the ligand-gated ion channel nicotinic receptors.
The murine embryonic stem cell line CGR8 synthesizes and releases non-neuronal acetylcholine.
In the present study a systematic investigation of the expression of nicotinic receptor subunits and muscarinic receptors was performed, when the stem cells were grown in the presence or absence of LIF, as the latter condition induces early differentiation.
CGR8 cells expressed multiple nicotinic receptor subtypes (α3, α4, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, β3, β4, γ, δ, ε) and muscarinic receptors (M1, M3, M4, M5); M2 was detected only in 2 out of 8 cultures.
LIF removal caused a down-regulation only of the α4- and β4-subunit.
In conclusion, more or less the whole repertoire of cholinergic receptors is expressed on the murine embryonic stem cell line CGR8 for mediating cellular signaling of non-neuronal acetylcholine which acts via auto- and paracrine pathways.
During early differentiation of the murine CGR8 stem cell signaling via nicotinic receptors containing α4- or β4 subunits is reduced.
Thus, the so-called neuronal α4 nicotine receptor composed of these subunits may be involved in the regulation of pluripotency in this murine stem cell line.'] 

27036552 Hmga2 is necessary for Otx2-dependent exit of embryonic stem cells from the pluripotent ground state.

In particular, Otx2 pioneers and activates new enhancers, which are silent in ESCs and which control the transcription of genes responsible for the acquisition of the EpiLC phenotype.

24704097 Comparison of osteoblast and cardiomyocyte differentiation in the embryonic stem cell test for predicting embryotoxicity in vivo.
['One of the most studied alternative embryotoxicity assays is the embryonic stem cell test, in which the effect of compounds on cardiomyocyte differentiation is evaluated (subsequently termed the ESTc).
This single differentiation endpoint may limit the predictive value of the assay.
We recently published a novel embryonic stem cell based osteoblast differentiation assay (subsequently termed the ESTo), in which we studied the effect of six embryotoxic compounds.
Differentiation is monitored via the differential expression of three genes related to osteogenesis (Runx2, SPARC and collagen type I).
In the current study, we evaluated the effect of 14 additional compounds in the ESTo, to assess its added value as compared to the ESTc.
To this end, we compared the effects of the compounds in the ESTo to their effects in the ESTc and to their published in vivo developmental toxicity profiles.
The results show that there is a high overall correlation between compound potencies as regards inhibition of osteoblast and cardiomyocyte differentiation.
Moreover, the results in both the ESTo and ESTc showed a significant correlation to in vivo developmental toxicity potency ranking of compounds tested.
Interestingly, the embryotoxic effect of TCDD could only be detected using the ESTo, which can be explained based on its mechanism of action and its known inhibitory effect on osteogenesis.
The results of TCDD suggest that incorporating the ESTo into a testing battery together with the ESTc could improve the overall predictive value of the battery.']

This embryonic stem cell-derived stomach tissue (e-ST) shared a similar gene expression profile with adult stomach, and secreted pepsinogen as well as gastric acid.

['A common challenge in avian cell biology is the generation of differentiated cell-lines, especially in the keratinocyte lineage.

During the last decade, mammalian embryonic stem cell-lines were shown to differentiate into almost all lineages, including keratinocytes.
Although chicken embryonic stem cells had been obtained in the 1990s, few differentiation studies toward the ectodermal lineage were reported.
Consequently, we explored the differentiation of chicken embryonic stem cells toward the keratinocyte lineage by using a combination of stromal induction, ascorbic acid, BMP4 and chicken serum.
During the induction period, we observed a downregulation of pluripotency markers and an upregulation of epidermal markers.
Three homogenous cell populations were derived, which were morphologically similar to chicken primary keratinocytes, displaying intracellular lipid droplets in almost every pavimentous cell.
These cells could be serially passaged without alteration of their morphology and showed gene and protein expression profiles of epidermal markers similar to chicken primary keratinocytes.

25555917 Efficient delivery and functional expression of transfected modified mRNA in human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigmented epithelial cells.
['Gene- and cell-based therapies are promising strategies for the treatment of degenerative retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt disease, and retinitis pigmentosa.
Cellular engineering before transplantation may allow the delivery of cellular factors that can promote functional improvements, such as increased engraftment or survival of transplanted cells.
A current challenge in traditional DNA-based vector transfection is to find a delivery system that is both safe and efficient, but using mRNA as an alternative to DNA can circumvent these major roadblocks.
In this study, we show that both unmodified and modified mRNA can be delivered to retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells with a high efficiency compared with conventional plasmid delivery systems.
On the other hand, administration of unmodified mRNA induced a strong innate immune response that was almost absent when using modified mRNA. Importantly, transfection of mRNA encoding a key regulator of RPE gene expression, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), confirmed the functionality of the delivered mRNA. Immunostaining showed that transfection with either type of mRNA led to the expression of roughly equal levels of MITF, primarily localized in the nucleus.
Despite these findings, quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the activation of the expression of MITF target genes was higher following transfection with modified mRNA compared with unmodified mRNA. Our findings, therefore, show that modified mRNA transfection can be applied to human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cells and that the method is safe, efficient, and functional.']

22238301 Varicella-zoster virus infects human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons and neurospheres but not pluripotent embryonic stem cells or early progenitors.
['Pluripotent human stem cells are a powerful tool for the generation of differentiated cells that can be used for the study of human disease.
We recently demonstrated that neurons derived from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be infected by the highly host-restricted human alphaherpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV), permitting the interaction of VZV with neurons to be readily evaluated in culture.
In the present study, we examine whether pluripotent hESC and neural progenitors at intermediate stages of differentiation are permissive for VZV infection.
We demonstrate here that VZV infection is blocked in naïve hESC.
A block to VZV replication is also seen when a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the VZV genome is transfected into hESC.
In contrast, related alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV) productively infect naïve hESC in a cell-free manner, and PrV replicates from a BAC transfected into hESC. Neurons differentiate from hESC via neural progenitor intermediates, as is the case in the embryo.
The first in vitro stage at which permissiveness of hESC-derived neural precursors to VZV replication is observed is upon formation of "neurospheres," immediately after detachment from the inductive stromal feeder layer.
These findings suggest that hESC may be useful in deciphering the yet enigmatic mechanisms of specificity of VZV infection and replication.']

23897760 Enrichment of human embryonic stem cell-derived NKX6.1-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells accelerates the maturation of insulin-secreting cells in vivo.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are considered a potential alternative to cadaveric islets as a source of transplantable cells for treating patients with diabetes.
We previously described a differentiation protocol to generate pancreatic progenitor cells from hESCs, composed of mainly pancreatic endoderm (PDX1/NKX6.1-positive), endocrine precursors (NKX2.2/synaptophysin-positive, hormone/NKX6.1-negative), and polyhormonal cells (insulin/glucagon-positive, NKX6.1-negative).
However, the relative contributions of NKX6.1-negative versus NKX6.1-positive cell fractions to the maturation of functional β-cells remained unclear.
To address this question, we generated two distinct pancreatic progenitor cell populations using modified differentiation protocols.
Prior to transplant, both populations contained a high proportion of PDX1-expressing cells (~85%-90%) but were distinguished by their relatively high (~80%) or low (~25%) expression of NKX6.1.
NKX6.1-high and NKX6.1-low progenitor populations were transplanted subcutaneously within macroencapsulation devices into diabetic mice.
Mice transplanted with NKX6.1-low cells remained hyperglycemic throughout the 5-month post-transplant period whereas diabetes was reversed in NKX6.1-high recipients within 3 months.
Fasting human C-peptide levels were similar between groups throughout the study, but only NKX6.1-high grafts displayed robust meal-, glucose- and arginine-responsive insulin secretion as early as 3 months post-transplant.
NKX6.1-low recipients displayed elevated fasting glucagon levels.
Theracyte devices from both groups contained almost exclusively pancreatic endocrine tissue, but NKX6.1-high grafts contained a greater proportion of insulin-positive and somatostatin-positive cells, whereas NKX6.1-low grafts contained mainly glucagon-expressing cells.
Insulin-positive cells in NKX6.1-high, but not NKX6.1-low grafts expressed nuclear MAFA.
Collectively, this study demonstrates that a pancreatic endoderm-enriched population can mature into highly functional β-cells with only a minor contribution from the endocrine subpopulation.'] 

24319666 L-Proline induces a mesenchymal-like invasive program in embryonic stem cells by remodeling H3K9 and H3K36 methylation.
['Metabolites are emerging as key mediators of crosstalk between metabolic flux, cellular signaling, and epigenetic regulation of cell fate.
We found that the nonessential amino acid L-proline (L-Pro) acts as a signaling molecule that promotes the conversion of embryonic stem cells into mesenchymal-like, spindle-shaped, highly motile, invasive pluripotent stem cells.
This embryonic-stem-cell-to-mesenchymal-like transition (esMT) is accompanied by a genome-wide remodeling of the H3K9 and H3K36 methylation status.
Consistently, L-Pro-induced esMT is fully reversible either after L-Pro withdrawal or by addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which in turn reduces H3K9 and H3K36 methylation, promoting a mesenchymal-like-to-embryonic-stem-cell transition (MesT).
These findings suggest that L-Pro, which is produced by proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix, may act as a microenvironmental cue to control stem cell behavior.']

22735451 Trim71 cooperates with microRNAs to repress Cdkn1a expression and promote embryonic stem cell proliferation.
['Pluripotent embryonic stem cells have a shortened cell cycle that enables their rapid proliferation.
The embryonic stem cell-specific miR-290 and miR-302 microRNA families promote proliferation whereas let-7 microRNAs inhibit self-renewal, and promote cell differentiation.
Lin28 suppresses let-7 expression in embryonic stem cells.
Here to gain further insight into mechanisms controlling embryonic stem cell self-renewal, we explore the molecular and cellular role of the let-7 target Trim71 (mLin41).
We show that Trim71 associates with Argonaute2 and microRNAs, and represses expression of Cdkn1a, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that negatively regulates the G1-S transition.
We identify protein domains required for Trim71 association with Argonaute2, localization to P-bodies, and for repression of reporter messenger RNAs.
Trim71 knockdown prolongs the G1 phase of the cell cycle and slows embryonic stem cell proliferation, a phenotype that was rescued by depletion of Cdkn1a.
Thus, we demonstrate that Trim71 is a factor that facilitates the G1-S transition to promote rapid embryonic stem cell self-renewal.'] 

25871791 Exogenous treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid supports maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells.
['Embryonic stem cells offer multiple advantages over adult stem cells in terms of achieving acceptable number of functional cardiomyocytes to be exploited in cell therapy.
However, differentiation efficacy is still a major issue to be solved before moving to regenerative medicine.
Although a vast number of chemical compounds have been tested on efficiency of cardiac differentiation, the effect of fish oil components, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on developmental bioenergetics, and hence cardiac differentiation, remained unstudied.
EPA has been reported to have several cardioprotective effects, but there is no study addressing its role in cardiac differentiation.
After mesoderm induction of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in hanging drops initiated by ascorbic acid, they were treated with various concentrations of EPA. Gene and protein expression and functional properties of cardiomyocytes derived from ESCs were evaluated following treatment with various concentrations of EPA. Exposure to low concentrations of EPA (10\xa0μM) increased percentage of beating colonies and beating area.
This treatment also resulted in up to 3 fold increase in expression of NKX2-5, MEF2C, MYH6, TNNT2 and CX43.
FACS analysis confirmed gene expression analysis with increased percentage of MYH6 positive cells in EPA-treated group compared to the control group.
In contrast, the expression of genes coding for cardiac differentiation, remained constant or even declined with higher concentrations of EPA.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that treatment of mESCs undergoing cardiac differentiation with low concentration, but not high concentration of EPA up-regulate transcription of genes associated with cardiac development.'] 

23460275 The use of human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells as the feeder layer to establish human embryonic stem cell lines.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent cells that have the potential to differentiate into the three germ layers and possibly all tissues of the human body.
To fulfil the clinical potentials for cell-based therapy, banks of hESC lines that express different combinations of the major histocompatibility genes should be established, preferably without exposing such cells to animal cells and proteins.
In this study, we tested human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) as feeder cells to support the growth of hESCs.
Our results indicated that mitomycin-treated AFMSCs were able to support the newly established hESC lines CGLK-1 and CGLK-2.
The hESC colonies cultured on AFMSCs expressed alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P), SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, Oct-4, Nanog and Sox-2, which are markers for undifferentiated hESCs.
Chromosomal analyses of both hESC lines, CGLK-1 and CGLK-2, which were cultured on AFMSC feeders for 22 and 14 passages, respectively, were confirmed to be normal karyotypes (46, XX).
The ability of AFMSCs as feeder cells to maintain the undifferentiated growth and pluripotency of hESCs was confirmed by in vivo formation of teratomas derived on AFMSC hESCs in severe combined immune-compromised mice.
The use of AFMSCs for feeder cells to culture hESCs has several advantages, in that AFMSCs are not tumourigenic and can be expanded extensively with a short doubling time.']

Here, we developed two novel feeder layers, mixed embryonic fibroblast feeder layers of mouse and bovine embryonic fibroblast at different ratios and sources including mouse fibroblast cell lines.
The bovine embryonic stem cell-like cells generated in our study displayed typical stem cell morphology and expressed specific markers such as OCT4, stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 and 4, alkaline phosphatase, SOX2, and NANOG mRNA levels.

24321709 The effects of artificial E-cadherin matrix-induced embryonic stem cell scattering on paxillin and RhoA activation via α-catenin.
['Mechanical forces have been shown to affect stem cell behavior in a large array of ways.
However, our understanding of how these mechanical cues may regulate the behavior of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains in its infancy.
Here, we aim to clarify the effect of cell scattering on the regulation of Rho family GTPases Rac1 and RhoA as well as paxillin.
Allowing ESCs to spread and scatter on a synthetically designed E-cadherin substratum causes phosphorylation of paxillin on consensus phosphorylation sites leading to activation of Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA.
By culturing cells in presence of RhoA activator or growing cells to a highly confluent state reverses the effect of cell scattering phenotype.
Knockdown of E-cadherin-adapter protein α-catenin revealed that it negatively affects paxillin phosphorylation and up-regulates RhoA activity in compact cellular aggregates.
Collectively these results indicate that cell scattering might cause a conformational change of α-catenin limiting its capacity to inhibit paxillin phosphorylation that causes an increase in Rac1 activation and RhoA deactivation.
Understanding how synthetically designed extracellular matrix affect ESC
signaling through mechanical cues brings a new aspect for stem cell engineers to develop technologies for controlling cell function.']

The CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex controls adult and embryonic stem cell differentiation and homeostasis.
['Little is known on post-transcriptional regulation of adult and embryonic stem cell maintenance and differentiation.
Here we characterize the role of Ddb1, a component of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex.
Ddb1 is highly expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and its deletion leads to abrogation of both adult and fetal hematopoiesis, targeting specifically transiently amplifying progenitor subsets.
However, Ddb1 deletion in non-dividing lymphocytes has no discernible phenotypes.
Ddb1 silencing activates Trp53 pathway and leads to significant effects on cell cycle progression and rapid apoptosis.
The abrogation of hematopoietic progenitor cells can be partially rescued by simultaneous deletion of Trp53.
Conversely, depletion of DDB1 in embryonic stem cell (ESC) leads to differentiation albeit negative effects on cell cycle and apoptosis.
Mass spectrometry reveals differing protein interactions between DDB1 and distinct DCAFs, the substrate recognizing components of the E3 complex, between cell types.
Our studies identify CUL4-DDB1 complex as a novel post-translational regulator of stem and progenitor maintenance and differentiation.'] 

25670856 Activin/nodal signaling switches the terminal fate of human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblasts.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been routinely treated with bone morphogenetic protein and/or inhibitors of activin/nodal signaling to obtain cells that express trophoblast markers.
Trophoblasts can terminally differentiate to either extravillous trophoblasts or syncytiotrophoblasts.
The signaling pathways that govern the terminal fate of these trophoblasts are not understood.
We show that activin/nodal signaling switches the terminal fate of these hESC-derived trophoblasts.
Inhibition of activin/nodal signaling leads to formation of extravillous trophoblast, whereas loss of activin/nodal inhibition leads to the formation of syncytiotrophoblasts.
Also, the ability of hESCs to form bona fide trophoblasts has been intensely debated.
We have examined hESC-derived trophoblasts in the light of stringent criteria that were proposed recently, such as hypomethylation of the ELF5-2b promoter region and down-regulation of HLA class I antigens.
We report that trophoblasts that possess these properties can indeed be obtained from hESCs.'] 

24397998 Fate of D3 mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to X-rays or carbon ions.
['The risk of radiation exposure during embryonic development is still a major problem in radiotoxicology.
In this study we investigated the response of the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) line D3 to two radiation qualities: sparsely ionizing X-rays and densely ionizing carbon ions.
We analyzed clonogenic cell survival, proliferation, induction of chromosome aberrations as well as the capability of cells to differentiate to beating cardiomyocytes up to 3 days after exposure.
Our results show that, for all endpoints investigated, carbon ions are more effective than X-rays at the same radiation dose.
Additionally, in long term studies (≥8 days post-irradiation) chromosomal damage and the pluripotency state were investigated.
These studies reveal that pluripotency markers are present in the progeny of cells surviving the exposure to both radiation types.
However, only in the progeny of X-ray exposed cells the aberration frequency was comparable to that of the control population, while the progeny of carbon ion irradiated cells harbored significantly more aberrations than the control, generally translocations.
We conclude that cells surviving the radiation exposure maintain pluripotency but may carry stable chromosomal rearrangements after densely ionizing radiation.']

However as this publication will show, this recovery of viable cells actually varies significantly by genetic background.
Therefore there is a need to improve the efficiency and reduce the variability of current mESC cryopreservation methods.

26577380 Identification of Small Molecules Which Induce Skeletal Muscle Differentiation in Embryonic Stem Cells via Activation of the Wnt and Inhibition of Smad2/3 and Sonic Hedgehog Pathways.
['The multilineage differentiation capacity of mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells offers a testing platform for small molecules that mediate mammalian lineage determination and cellular specialization.
Here we report the identification of two small molecules which drives mouse 129 ES cell differentiation to skeletal muscle with high efficiency without any genetic modification.
Mouse embryoid bodies (EBs) were used to screen a library of 1,000 small molecules to identify compounds capable of inducing high levels of Pax3 mRNA. Stimulation of EBs with SMIs (skeletal muscle inducer, SMI1 and SMI2) from the screen resulted in a high percentage of intensively twitching skeletal muscle fibers 3 weeks after induction.
Gene expression profiling studies that were carried out for mode of actions analysis showed that SMIs activated genes regulated by the Wnt pathway and inhibited expression of Smad2/3 and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) target genes.
A combination of three small molecules known to modulate these three pathways acted similarly to the SMIs found here, driving ES cells from 129 as well as Balb/c and C57Bl/6 to skeletal muscle.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the SMI drives ES cells to skeletal muscle via concerted activation of the Wnt pathway, and inhibition of Smad2/3 signaling and Shh pathways.
This provides important developmental biological information about skeletal muscle differentiation from embryonic stem cells and may lead to the development of new therapeutics for muscle disease.'] 

25205822 Composition and function of macroencapsulated human embryonic stem cell-derived implants: comparison with clinical human islet cell grafts.

Pancreatic (non)endocrine cells can develop from human embryonic stem (huES) cells following in vitro derivation to pancreatic endoderm (PE) that is subsequently implanted in immune-incompetent mice for further differentiation.
Encapsulation of PE increases the proportion of endocrine cells in subcutaneous implants, with enrichment in β-cells when they are placed in TheraCyte-macrodevices and predominantly α-cells when they are alginate-microencapsulated.
At posttransplant (PT) weeks 20-30, macroencapsulated huES implants presented higher glucose-responsive plasma C-peptide levels and a lower proinsulin-over-C-peptide ratio than human islet cell implants under the kidney capsule.
Their ex vivo analysis showed the presence of single-hormone-positive α- and β-cells that exhibited rapid secretory responses to increasing and decreasing glucose concentrations, similar to isolated human islet cells.
However, their insulin secretory amplitude was lower, which was attributed in part to a lower cellular hormone content; it was associated with a lower glucose-induced insulin biosynthesis, but not with lower glucagon-induced stimulation, which together is compatible with an immature functional state of the huES-derived β-cells at PT weeks 20-30.
These data support the therapeutic potential of macroencapsulated huES implants but indicate the need for further functional analysis.

26773463 Long-term, feeder-free maintenance of human embryonic stem cells by mussel-inspired adhesive heparin and collagen type I. [StringElement("For practical applications of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine, hESCs should be cultured on a large scale, and at the same time their properties have to be maintained in a controllable manner.

This platform utilizes a wet-adhesive, mussel-inspired heparin-catechol conjugate as a key component.
We hypothesized that the heparin's affinity toward a wide range of proteins, might support undifferentiated in vitro growth of hESC.
In fact, on the HepC-coated substrate, most hESC clumps were adhered (∼78% at passage 2 (P2)) and expressed pluripotency markers (Fig. 2).
Although HepC alone wasn't able to support long-term maintenance of hESCs in a feeder-free system due to decrease in the adhesion rate of hESCs on HepC coating (∼ 44% at P4) during the repeated passaging processes, we found that when collagen type I was co-immobilized in the process of HepC coating, the long-term maintenance (passage 18 or more) of hESCs could be achieved with 100% adhesion efficiency (Fig. 4).
One remarkable observation is that hESCs on collagen type-I underwent spontaneous differentiation after P6 (Fig. 3), which implied co-immobilized HepC played a role to suppress differentiation of hESCs.

['This chapter describes standard techniques to (1) maintain mouse embryonic stem cell culture, (2) deliver transgenes into mouse embryonic stem cells mediated by electroporation, nucleofection, lipofection, and retro/lentiviruses, and (3) assess the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells.
The last part of this chapter presents induction of random cell differentiation followed by the alkaline phosphatase and embryoid body formation assays, immunofluorescence microscopy, and the teratoma formation assay.']

Retinoic acid signaling and mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation: Cross talk between genomic and non-genomic effects of RA. ["Retinoic acid (RA), the active derivative of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, plays key roles in cell growth and differentiation by activating nuclear receptors, RARs (α, β and γ), which are ligand dependent regulators of transcription.
The past years highlighted several novelties in the field that increased the complexity of RA effects.
Indeed, in addition to its classical genomic effects, RA also has extranuclear and non-transcriptional effects.
RA induces the rapid and transient activation of kinase cascades, which are integrated in the nucleus via the phosphorylation of RARs at a conserved serine residue located in the N-terminal domain and their coregulators.
In order to investigate the relevance of RARs' phosphorylation in cell differentiation, mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells were used as a model.
When treated with RA, these pluripotent cells give rise to neuronal cells.
Cells invalidated for each RAR were generated as well as stable rescue lines expressing RARs mutated in phosphor acceptor sites.
Such a strategy revealed that RA-induced neuronal differentiation involves the RARγ2 subtype and requires RARγ2 phosphorylation.
Moreover, in gene expression profiling experiments, the phosphorylated form of RARγ2 was found to regulate a small subset of genes through binding a novel RA response element consisting of two direct repeats with a 7 base pair spacer.
These new findings suggest an important role for RAR phosphorylation during cell differentiation, and pave the way for further investigations with other cell types and during embryonic development.

24756727 Potential for cell therapy in Parkinson's disease using genetically programmed human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells.
["Neural transplantation is a promising strategy for restoring dopaminergic dysfunction and modifying disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD).
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential resource in this regard because of their ability to provide a virtually limitless supply of homogenous dopaminergic progenitors and neurons of appropriate lineage.
The recent advances in developing robust cell culture protocols for directed differentiation of hESCs to near pure populations of ventral mesencephalic (A9-type) dopaminergic neurons has heightened the prospects for PD cell therapy.
Here, we focus our review on current state-of-the-art techniques for harnessing hESC-based strategies toward development of a stem cell therapeutic for PD.
Importantly, we also briefly describe a novel genetic-programming approach that may address many of the key challenges that remain in the field and that may hasten clinical translation."] 

24347171 The death-inducer obliterator 1 (Dido1) gene regulates embryonic stem cell self-renewal.
['The regulatory network of factors that center on master transcription factors such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 help maintain embryonic stem (ES) cells and ensure their pluripotency.
The target genes of these master transcription factors define the ES cell transcriptional landscape.
In this study, we report our findings that Dido1, a target of canonical transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, plays an important role in regulating ES cell maintenance.
We found that depletion of Dido1 in mouse ES cells led to differentiation, and ectopic expression of Dido1 inhibited differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal.
We further demonstrated that whereas Nanog and Oct4 could occupy the Dido1 locus and promote its transcription, Dido1 could also target to the loci of pluripotency factors such as Nanog and Oct4 and positively regulate their expression.
Through this feedback and feedforward loop, Dido1 is able to regulate self-renewal of mouse ES cells.'] 

24217388 Gain of 20q11.21 in human embryonic stem cells improves cell survival by increased expression of Bcl-xL. ['Gain of 20q11.21 is a chromosomal abnormality that is recurrently found in human pluripotent stem cells and cancers, strongly suggesting that this mutation confers a proliferative or survival advantage to these cells.
In this work we studied three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines that acquired a gain of 20q11.21 during in vitro culture.
The study of the mRNA gene expression levels of the loci located in the common region of duplication showed that HM13, ID1, BCL2L1, KIF3B and the immature form of the micro-RNA miR-1825 were up-regulated in mutant cells.
ID1 and BCL2L1 were further studied as potential drivers of the phenotype of hESC with a 20q11.21 gain.
We found no increase in the protein levels of ID1, nor the downstream effects expected from over-expression of this gene.
On the other hand, hESC with a gain of 20q11.21 had on average a 3-fold increase of Bcl-xL (the anti-apoptotic isoform of BCL2L1) protein levels.
The mutant hESC underwent 2- to 3-fold less apoptosis upon loss of cell-to-cell contact and were ∼2-fold more efficient in forming colonies from a single cell.
The key role of BCL2L1 in this mutation was further confirmed by transgenic over-expression of BCL2L1 in the wild-type cells, leading to apoptosis-resistant cells, and BCL2L1-knock-down in the mutant hESC, resulting in a restoration of the wild-type phenotype.
This resistance to apoptosis supposes a significant advantage for the mutant cells, explaining the high frequency of gains of 20q11.21 in human pluripotent stem cells.'] 

22713752 Histone modifications and lamin
A regulate chromatin protein dynamics in early embryonic stem cell differentiation.
["Embryonic stem cells are characterized by unique epigenetic features including decondensed chromatin and hyperdynamic association of chromatin proteins with chromatin.
Here we investigate the potential mechanisms that regulate chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells.
Using epigenetic drugs and mutant embryonic stem cells lacking various chromatin proteins, we find that histone acetylation, G9a-mediated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and lamin
A expression, all affect chromatin protein dynamics.
Histone acetylation controls, almost exclusively, euchromatin protein dynamics; lamin A expression regulates heterochromatin protein dynamics, and G9a regulates both euchromatin and heterochromatin protein dynamics.
In contrast, we find that DNA methylation and nucleosome repeat length have little or no effect on chromatin-binding protein dynamics in embryonic stem cells.
Altered chromatin dynamics associates with perturbed embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Together, these data provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic pathways that are responsible for chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells, and indicate that the genome's epigenetic state modulates chromatin plasticity and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells.

25350134 Retroviral infection of murine embryonic stem cell derived embryoid body cells for analysis of hematopoietic differentiation.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an outstanding model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cellular differentiation.
They are especially useful for investigating the development of early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).
Gene expression in ESCs can be manipulated by several techniques that allow the role for individual molecules in development to be determined.
One difficulty is that expression of specific genes often has different phenotypic effects dependent on their temporal expression.
This problem can be circumvented by the generation of ESCs that inducibly express a gene of interest using technology such as the doxycycline-inducible transgene system.
However, generation of these inducible cell lines is costly and time consuming.
Described here is a method for disaggregating ESC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) into single cell suspensions, retrovirally infecting the cell suspensions, and then reforming the EBs by hanging drop.
Downstream differentiation is then evaluated by flow cytometry.
Using this protocol, it was demonstrated that exogenous expression of a microRNA gene at the beginning of ESC differentiation blocks HPC generation.
However, when expressed in EB derived cells after nascent mesoderm is produced, the microRNA gene enhances hematopoietic differentiation.
This method is useful for investigating the role of genes after specific germ layer tissue is derived.'] 

23940003 Generation and characterization of spiking and nonspiking oligodendroglial progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells.
['Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been differentiated into oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs), providing promising cell replacement therapies for many central nervous system disorders.
Studies from rodents have shown that brain OPCs express a variety of ion channels, and that a subset of brain OPCs express voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV ), mediating the spiking properties of OPCs.
However, it is unclear whether PSC-derived OPCs exhibit electrophysiological properties similar to brain OPCs and the role of NaV in the functional maturation of OPCs is unknown.
Here, using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Olig2 knockin reporter line, we demonstrated that unlike brain OPCs, all the GFP(+) /Olig2(+) mESC-derived OPCs (mESC-OPCs) did not express functional NaV and failed to generate spikes (hence termed "nonspiking mESC-OPCs"), while expressing the delayed rectifier and inactivating potassium currents.
By ectopically expressing NaV 1.2 α subunit via viral transduction, we successfully generated mESC-OPCs with spiking properties (termed "spiking mESC-OPCs").
After transplantation into the spinal cord and brain of myelin-deficient shiverer mice, the spiking mESC-OPCs demonstrated better capability in differentiating into myelin basic protein expressing oligodendrocytes and in myelinating axons in vivo than the nonspiking mESC-OPCs.
Thus, by generating spiking and nonspiking mESC-OPCs, this study reveals a novel function of NaV in OPCs in their functional maturation and myelination, and sheds new light on ways to effectively develop PSC-derived OPCs for future clinical applications.'] 

24805944 sRNA-seq analysis of human embryonic stem cells and definitive endoderm reveals differentially expressed microRNAs and novel IsomiRs with distinct targets.
['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding, regulatory RNAs expressed dynamically during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into defined lineages.
Mapping developmental expression of miRNAs during transition from pluripotency to definitive endoderm (DE) should help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying lineage specification and ultimately enhance differentiation protocols.
In this report, next generation sequencing was used to build upon our previous analysis of miRNA expression in human hESCs and DE.
From millions of sequencing reads, 747 and 734 annotated miRNAs were identified in pluripotent and DE cells, respectively, including 77 differentially expressed miRNAs.
Among these, four of the top five upregulated miRNAs were previously undetected in DE.
Furthermore, the stem-loop for miR-302a, an important miRNA for both hESCs self-renewal and endoderm specification, produced several highly expressed miRNA species (isomiRs).
Overall, isomiRs represented >10% of sequencing reads in >40% of all detected stem-loop arms, suggesting that the impact of these abundant miRNA species may have been overlooked in previous studies.
Because of their relative abundance, the role of differential isomiR targeting was studied using the miR-302 cluster as a model system.
A miRNA mimetic for miR-302a-5p, but not miR-302a-5p(+3), decreased expression of orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2).
Conversely, isomiR 302a-5p(+3) selectively decreased expression of tuberous sclerosis protein 1, but not OTX2, indicating nonoverlapping specificity of miRNA processing variants.
Taken together, our characterization of miRNA expression, which includes novel miRNAs and isomiRs, helps establish a foundation for understanding the role of miRNAs in DE formation and selective targeting by isomiRs.'] 

24268252 Mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under serum- and feeder-free conditions maintain their self-renewal capacity on hydroxyapatite.
['New tissue engineering techniques based on embryonic stem (ES) cells and artificial scaffolds are required for regenerative medicine.
Because artificial scaffolds can regulate the differentiation states of ES cells, compatibility between the cells and artificial scaffolds is important.
To our knowledge, this study is the first report showing that mouse ES (mES) cells can be maintained in undifferentiated state on hydroxyapatite coated with gelatin.
In contrast to previous studies, our culture medium was serum-free and included a GSK-3 inhibitor.
Under these conditions, mES colony morphology was similar to that of an undifferentiated state; mES cells expressed the pluripotent-specific factors Oct-3/4 and Nanog, and they maintained the ability to differentiate into the three germ layers.
Moreover, a GSK-3 inhibitor blocked the expression of integrin subunits that bind to laminin which are known to induce the differentiation of mES cells.
These findings indicate that mES cells can be cultured under serum- and feeder-free conditions and maintained in an undifferentiated state on a composite with hydroxyapatite and that this composite can be used to control the differentiation of stem cells.'] 

25132103 Brief report: complement C5a promotes human embryonic stem cell pluripotency in the absence of FGF2.
['The complement activation product, C5a, is a pivotal member of the innate immune response; however, a diverse number of nonimmune functions are now being ascribed to C5a signaling, including roles during embryonic development.
Here, we identify the expression of the C5a precursor protein, C5, as well as the C5a receptors, C5aR and C5L2, in both human embryonic stem cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cells.
We show that administration of a physiologically relevant dose of purified human C5a (1 nM) stimulates activation of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, and is able to promote maintenance of the pluripotent state in the absence of FGF2.
C5a also reduced cell loss following dissociation of human pluripotent stem cells.
Our results reveal that complement C5a signaling supports human stem cell pluripotency and survival, and thus may play a key role in shaping early human embryonic development.'] 

23658023 Comparative proteomic analysis of supportive and unsupportive extracellular matrix substrates for human embryonic stem cell maintenance.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent cells that have indefinite replicative potential and the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers.
hESCs are conventionally grown on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or feeder cells of human origin.
In addition, feeder-free culture systems can be used to support hESCs, in which the adhesive substrate plays a key role in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal or differentiation.
Extracellular matrix (ECM) components define the microenvironment of the niche for many types of stem cells, but their role in the maintenance of hESCs remains poorly understood.
We used a proteomic approach to characterize in detail the composition and interaction networks of ECMs that support the growth of self-renewing hESCs.
Whereas many ECM components were produced by supportive and unsupportive MEF and human placental stromal fibroblast feeder cells, some proteins were only expressed in supportive ECM, suggestive of a role in the maintenance of pluripotency.
We show that identified candidate molecules can support attachment and self-renewal of hESCs alone (fibrillin-1) or in combination with fibronectin (perlecan, fibulin-2), in the absence of feeder cells.
Together, these data highlight the importance of specific ECM interactions in the regulation of hESC phenotype and provide a resource for future studies of hESC self-renewal.'] 

24446170 MicroRNA screen of human embryonic stem cell differentiation reveals miR-105 as an enhancer of megakaryopoiesis from adult CD34+ cells.
["MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can control stem cell differentiation by targeting mRNAs.
Using 96-well plate electroporation, we screened 466 human miRNA mimics by four-color flow cytometry to explore differentiation of common myeloid progenitors (CMP) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
The transfected cells were then cultured in a cytokine cocktail that supported multiple hematopoietic lineages.
At 4-5 days post-transfection, flow cytometry of erythroid (CD235(+)CD41(-)), megakaryocyte (CD41(+)CD42(+)), and myeloid (CD18(+)CD235(-))
lineages revealed miR-105 as a novel enhancer of megakaryocyte production during in vitro primitive hematopoiesis.
In hESC-derived CMPs, miR-105 caused a sixfold enhancement in megakaryocyte production.
miR-513a, miR-571, and miR-195 were found to be less potent megakaryocyte enhancers.
We confirmed the relevance of miR-105 in adult megakaryopoiesis by demonstrating increased megakaryocyte yield and megakaryocyte colony forming potential in human adult CD34(+) cells derived from peripheral blood.
In addition, adult CD34(+) cells express endogenous miR-105 during megakaryocyte differentiation.
siRNA knockdown of the hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb caused a similar enhancement of megakaryocyte production as miR-105.
Finally, a luciferase/c-Myb-3'UTR construct and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb mRNA was a target of miR-105.
We report a novel hESC-based miR screening platform and demonstrate that miR-105 is an enhancer of megakaryopoiesis in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis."] 

24324277 Small molecule-mediated directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells toward ventricular cardiomyocytes.
['The generation of human ventricular cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells and/or induced pluripotent stem cells could fulfill the demand for therapeutic applications and in vitro pharmacological research; however, the production of a homogeneous population of ventricular cardiomyocytes remains a major limitation.
By combining small molecules and growth factors, we developed a fully chemically defined, directed differentiation system to generate ventricular-like cardiomyocytes (VCMs) from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells with high efficiency and reproducibility.
Molecular characterization revealed that the differentiation recapitulated the developmental steps of cardiovascular fate specification.
Electrophysiological analyses further illustrated the generation of a highly enriched population of VCMs.
These chemically induced VCMs exhibited the expected cardiac electrophysiological and calcium handling properties as well as the appropriate chronotropic responses to cardioactive compounds.
In addition, using an integrated computational and experimental systems biology approach, we demonstrated that the modulation of the canonical Wnt pathway by the small molecule IWR-1 plays a key role in cardiomyocyte subtype specification.
In summary, we developed a reproducible and efficient experimental platform that facilitates a chemical genetics-based interrogation of signaling pathways during cardiogenesis that bypasses the limitations of genetic approaches and provides a valuable source of ventricular cardiomyocytes for pharmacological screenings as well as cell replacement therapies.'] 

26542134 Putative embryonic stem cells derived from porcine cloned blastocysts using induced pluripotent stem cells as donors.
['The establishment of porcine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) would have great impact in biomedical studies and preclinical trials through their use in genetic engineering.
However, authentic porcine ESCs have not been established until now.
In this study, a total of seven putative ESC lines were derived from porcine embryos of various origins, including in\xa0vitro fertilization, parthenogenetic activation, and, in particular, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) nuclear transfer (NT) from a donor cell with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
To characterize these cell lines, several assays including an assessment of intensive alkaline phosphatase activity, karyotyping, embryoid body formation, expression analysis of the pluripotency-associated markers, and the three germ layerassociated markers were performed.
Based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the expression levels of REX1 and FGFR2 in iPS-NT lines were higher than those of cells of other origins.
Additionally, only iPS-NT lines showed multiple aberrant patterns of nuclear foci elucidated by immunofluorescence staining of H3K27me3 as a marker of the state of X chromosome inactivation and a less mature form of mitochondria like naive ESCs, by transmission electron microscopy.
Together, these data suggested that established putative porcine ESC lines generally exhibited a primed pluripotent state, like human ESCs.
However, iPS-NT lines have especially unique characteristics distinct from other origins because they have more epigenetic instability and naive-like mitochondrial morphology than other putative ESC lines.
This is the first study to establish and characterize the iPSC-derived putative ESC lines and compare them with other lines derived from different origins in pigs.'] 

24898727 B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 regulates human embryonic stem cell adhesion, stemness, and survival via control of epithelial cell adhesion molecule.
['B-Cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) regulates the export of secreted membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the downstream secretory pathway.
Previously, we generated a monoclonal antibody 297-D4 against the surface molecule on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
Here, we found that 297-D4 antigen was localized to pluripotent hESCs and downregulated during early differentiation of hESCs and identified that the antigen target of 297-D4 was BAP31 on the hESC-surface.
To investigate the functional role of BAP31 in hESCs, BAP31 expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA. BAP31 depletion impaired hESC self-renewal and pluripotency and drove hESC differentiation into multicell lineages.
BAP31 depletion hindered hESC proliferation by arresting cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and inducing caspase-independent cell death.
Interestingly, BAP31 depletion reduced hESC adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM).
Analysis of cell surface molecules showed decreased expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in BAP31-depleted hESCs, while ectopic expression of BAP31 elevated the expression of EpCAM. EpCAM depletion also reduced hESC adhesion to ECM, arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced cell death, producing similar effects to those of BAP31 depletion.
BAP31 and EpCAM were physically associated and colocalized at the ER and cell surface.
Both BAP31 and EpCAM depletion decreased cyclin D1 and E expression and suppressed PI3K/Akt signaling, suggesting that BAP31 regulates hESC stemness and survival via control of EpCAM expression.
These findings provide, for the first time, mechanistic insights into how BAP31 regulates hESC stemness and survival via control of EpCAM expression.'] 

26162091 Retinoic Acid Induces Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation by Altering Both Encoding RNA and microRNA Expression.
['Retinoic acid (RA) is a vitamin A metabolite that is essential for early embryonic development and promotes stem cell neural lineage specification; however, little is known regarding the impact of RA on mRNA transcription and microRNA levels on embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Here, we present mRNA microarray and microRNA high-output sequencing to clarify how RA regulates gene expression.
Using mRNA microarray analysis, we showed that RA repressed pluripotency-associated genes while activating ectoderm markers in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
Moreover, RA modulated the DNA methylation of mESCs by altering the expression of epigenetic-associated genes such as Dnmt3b and Dnmt3l.
Furthermore, H3K4me2, a pluripotent histone modification, was repressed by RA stimulation.
From microRNA sequence data, we identified two downregulated microRNAs, namely, miR-200b and miR-200c, which regulated the pluripotency of stem cells.
We found that miR-200b or miR-200c deficiency suppressed the expression of pluripotent genes, including Oct4 and Nanog, and activated the expression of the ectodermal marker gene Nestin.
These results demonstrate that retinoid induces mESCs to differentiate by regulating miR-200b/200c.
Our findings provide the landscapes of mRNA and microRNA gene networks and indicate the crucial role of miR-200b/200c in the RA-induced differentiation of mESCs.'] 

25472739 Cell polarity and neurogenesis in embryonic stem cell-derived neural rosettes.
["Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergoing neural differentiation form radial arrays of neural stem cells, termed neural rosettes.
These structures manifest many of the properties associated with embryonic and adult neurogenesis, including cell polarization, interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), and a gradient of neuronal differentiation.
We now identify novel rosette structural features that serve to localize key regulators of neurogenesis.
Cells within neural rosettes have specialized basal as well as apical surfaces, based on localization of the extracellular matrix receptor β1 integrin.
Apical processes of cells in mature rosettes terminate at the lumen, where adherens junctions are apparent.
Primary cilia are randomly distributed in immature rosettes and tightly associated with the neural stem cell's apical domain as rosettes mature.
Components of two signaling pathways known to regulate neurogenesis in vivo and in rosettes, Hedgehog and Notch, are apically localized, with the Hedgehog effector Smoothened (Smo) associated with primary cilia and the Notch pathway γ-secretase subunit Presenilin 2 associated with the adherens junction.
Increased neuron production upon treatment with the Notch inhibitor DAPT suggests a major role for Notch signaling in maintaining the neural stem cell state, as previously described.
A less robust outcome was observed with manipulation of Hedgehog levels, though consistent with a role in neural stem cell survival or proliferation.
Inhibition of both pathways resulted in an additive effect.
These data support a model by which cells extending a process to the rosette lumen maintain neural stem cell identity whereas release from this association, either through asymmetric cell division or apical abscission, promotes neuronal differentiation."] 

25520282 Derivation of Neural Precursor Cells from Human Embryonic Stem Cells for DNA Methylomic Analysis.
['Embryonic stem cells are self-renewing pluripotent cells with competency to differentiate into all three-germ lineages.

Proper regulation should be ensured to maintain their unique self-renewal and undifferentiated characteristics.
Understanding key mechanisms in stem cell biology will be important for the successful application of stem cells for regenerative therapeutic medicine.
More importantly practical use of stem cells will require our knowledge on how to properly direct and differentiate stem cells into the necessary type of cells.
Embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells have been used as study models to unveil molecular and cellular mechanisms in various signaling pathways.

In fact, ESCs can differentiate in culture to mimic embryonic development in vivo, or specifically to virtually any kind of somatic cells.
Here, we used the toxicant Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical known as a hazard to infants and children, and showed that our stem cell toxicology system was able to efficiently recapitulate most of the toxic effects of BPA previously detected by in vitro system or animal tests.
More precisely, we demonstrated that BPA affected the proper specification of germ layers during our in vitro mimicking of the embryonic development, as well as the establishment of neural ectoderm and neural progenitor cells.'] 

25618825 Administration of embryonic stem cell-derived thymic epithelial progenitors expressing MOG induces antigen-specific tolerance and ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
['Tolerance induction, and thus prevention or treatment of autoimmune disease, is not only associated with the persistent presence of self-antigen in the thymus, but also relies on a functional thymus; however, the thymus undergoes profound age-dependent involution.
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are the major component of the thymic microenvironment for T cell development.
We have reported that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be induced in vitro to generate thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs) that further develop into functional TECs in vivo.
We show here that transplantation of mESC-TEPs expressing self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in mice results in enhanced T cell regeneration, long-term expression of MOG in the thymus, prevention of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) development, and remission of established EAE. Our findings indicate that transplantation of ESC-TEPs expressing disease-causative self-antigen(s) may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease.'] 

25849374 Transcriptional profiling of ectoderm specification to keratinocyte fate in human embryonic stem cells.
['In recent years, several studies have shed light into the processes that regulate epidermal specification and homeostasis.
We previously showed that a broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT promoted early keratinocyte specification in human embryonic stem cells triggered to undergo ectoderm specification.
Here, we show that DAPT accelerates human embryonic stem cell differentiation and induces expression of the ectoderm protein AP2.
Furthermore, we utilize RNA sequencing to identify several candidate regulators of ectoderm specification including those involved in epithelial and epidermal development in human embryonic stem cells.
Genes associated with transcriptional regulation and growth factor activity are significantly enriched upon DAPT treatment during specification of human embryonic stem cells to the ectoderm lineage.
The human ectoderm cell signature identified in this study contains several genes expressed in ectodermal and epithelial tissues.
Importantly, these genes are also associated with skin disorders and ectodermal defects, providing a platform for understanding the biology of human epidermal keratinocyte development under diseased and homeostatic conditions.'] 

25177806 Zinc-finger nuclease enhanced gene targeting in human embryonic stem cells.
["One major limitation with current human embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation protocols is the generation of heterogeneous cell populations.
These cultures contain the cells of interest, but are also contaminated with undifferentiated ESCs, non-neural derivatives and other neuronal subtypes.
This limits their use in in vitro and in vivo applications, such as in vitro modeling for drug discovery or cell replacement therapy.
To help overcome this, reporter cell lines, which offer a means to visualize, track and isolate cells of interest, can be engineered.
However, to achieve this in human embryonic stem cells via conventional homologous recombination is extremely inefficient.
This protocol describes targeting of the Pituitary homeobox 3 (PITX3) locus in human embryonic stem cells using custom designed zinc-finger nucleases, which introduce site-specific double-strand DNA breaks, together with a PITX3-EGFP-specific DNA donor vector.
Following the generation of the PITX3 reporter cell line, it can then be differentiated using published protocols for use in studies such as in vitro Parkinson's disease modeling or cell replacement therapy."] 

23580653 Mouse embryonic stem cells are deficient in type I interferon expression in response to viral infections and double-stranded RNA. ['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are considered to be a promising cell source for regenerative medicine because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation.
However, little is known about the innate immunity in ESCs and ESC-derived cells.
We investigated the responses of mouse (m)ESCs to three types of live viruses as follows: La Crosse virus, West Nile virus, and Sendai virus.
Our results demonstrated mESCs were susceptible to viral infection, but they were unable to express type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ, IFNα/β), which differ from fibroblasts (10T1/2 cells) that robustly express IFNα/β upon viral infections.
The failure of mESCs to express IFNα/β was further demonstrated by treatment with polyIC, a synthetic viral dsRNA analog that strongly induced IFNα/β in 10T1/2 cells.
Although polyIC transiently inhibited the transcription of pluripotency markers, the stem cell morphology was not significantly affected.
However, polyIC can induce dsRNA-activated protein kinase in mESCs, and this activation resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation.
We conclude that the cytosolic receptor dsRNA-activated protein kinase is functional, but the mechanisms that mediate type I IFN expression are deficient in mESCs.
This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the major viral RNA receptors are either expressed at very low levels (TLR3 and MDA5) or may not be active (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) in mESCs.']

26072468 Comparison of gene expression regulation in mouse- and human embryonic stem cell assays during neural differentiation and in response to valproic acid exposure.
['Embryonic stem cell tests (EST) are considered promising alternative assays for developmental toxicity testing.
Classical mouse derived assays (mEST) are being replaced by human derived assays (hEST), in view of their relevance for human hazard assessment.
We have compared mouse and human neural ESTn assays for neurodevelopmental toxicity as to regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation in both assays.
Commonalities were observed in a range of neurodevelopmental genes and gene ontology (GO) terms.
The mESTn showed a higher specificity in neurodevelopment than the hESTn, which may in part be caused by necessary differences in test protocols.
Moreover, gene expression responses to the anticonvulsant and human teratogen valproic acid were compared.
Both assays detected pharmacological and neurodevelopmental gene sets regulated by valproic acid.
Common significant expression changes were observed in a subset of homologous neurodevelopmental genes.
We suggest that these genes and related GO terms may provide good candidates for robust biomarkers of neurodevelopmental toxicity in hESTn.']

24989326 Induction of primordial germ cell-like cells from mouse embryonic stem cells by ERK signal inhibition.
['Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic germ cell precursors.
Specification of PGCs occurs under the influence of mesodermal induction signaling during in vivo gastrulation.
Although bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnt signaling play pivotal roles in both mesodermal and PGC specification, the signal regulating PGC specification remains unknown.
Coculture of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with OP9 feeder cells induces mesodermal differentiation in vitro.
Using this mesodermal differentiation system, we demonstrated that PGC-like cells were efficiently induced from mouse ESCs by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling inhibition.
Inhibition of ERK signaling by a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor upregulated germ cell marker genes but downregulated mesodermal genes.
In addition, the PGC-like cells showed downregulation of DNA methylation and formed pluripotent stem cell colonies upon treatment with retinoic acid.
These results show that inhibition of ERK signaling suppresses mesodermal differentiation but activates germline differentiation program in this mesodermal differentiation system.
Our findings provide a new insight into the signaling networks regulating PGC specification.'] 

26683311 Different concentrations of kaempferol distinctly modulate murine embryonic stem cell function.
["Kaempferol (3,4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid with several beneficial and protective effects.
It has been demonstrated that kaempferol has anticancer properties, particularly due to its effects on proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle.
However, possible effects on pluripotent embryonic stem cell function have not yet been addressed.
Embryonic stem cells have the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into all three germ layers with potential applications in regenerative medicine and in\xa0vitro toxicology.
We show that exposure of murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) to high concentrations of kaempferol (200\xa0μM) leads to decreased cell numbers, although the resulting smaller cell colonies remain pluripotent.
However, lower concentrations of this compound (20\xa0μM) increase the expression of pluripotency markers in mESCs.
Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass are not affected, but a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis takes place.
Moreover, mESC differentiation is impaired by kaempferol, which was not related to apoptosis induction.
Our results show that low concentrations of kaempferol can be beneficial for pluripotency, but inhibit proper differentiation of mESCs.
Additionally, high concentrations induce apoptosis and increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)."]

24549637 Transcription factor-induced lineage programming of noradrenaline and motor neurons from embryonic stem cells.
['An important goal in stem cell biology is to develop methods for efficient generation of clinically interesting cell types from relevant stem cell populations.
This is particularly challenging for different types of neurons of the central nervous system where hundreds of distinct neuronal cell types are generated during embryonic development.
We previously used a strategy based on forced transcription factor expression in embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors to generate specific types of neurons, including dopamine and serotonin neurons.
Here, we extend these studies and show that noradrenergic neurons can also be generated from pluripotent embryonic stem cells by forced expression of the homeobox transcription factor Phox2b under the signaling influence of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and bone morphogenetic proteins.
In neural progenitors exposed to FGF8 and sonic hedgehog both Phox2b and the related Phox2a instead promoted the generation of neurons with the characteristics of mid- and hindbrain motor neurons.
The efficient generation of these neuron types enabled a comprehensive genome-wide gene expression analysis that provided further validation of the identity of generated cells.
Moreover, we also demonstrate that the generated cell types are amenable to drug testing in vitro and we show that variants of the differentiation protocols can be applied to cultures of human pluripotent stem cells for the generation of human noradrenergic and visceral motor neurons.
Thus, these studies provide a basis for characterization of yet an additional highly clinically relevant neuronal cell type.'] 

26076706 Derivation of a Homozygous Human Androgenetic Embryonic Stem Cell Line.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have long been considered as a promising source for cell replacement therapy.
However, one major obstacle for the use of these cells is immune compatibility.
Histocompatible human parthenogenetic ESCs have been reported as a new method for generating human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched hESCs.
To further investigate the possibility of obtaining histocompatible stem cells from uniparental embryos, we tried to produce androgenetic haploid human embryos by injecting a single spermatozoon into enucleated human oocyte, and establish human androgenetic embryonic stem (hAGES) cell lines from androgenetic embryos.
In the present study, a diploid hAGES cell line has been established, which exhibits typical features of human ESCs, including the expression of pluripotency markers, having differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo, and stable propagation in an undifferentiated state (>P40).
Bisulfite sequencing of the H19, Snrpn, Meg3, and Kv imprinting control regions suggested that hAGES cells maintained to a certain extent a sperm methylation pattern.
Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism, short tandem repeat, and HLA analyses revealed that the hAGES cell genome was highly homozygous.
These results suggest that hAGES cells from spermatozoon could serve as a useful tool for studying the mechanisms underlying genomic imprinting in humans.
It might also be used as a potential resource for cell replacement therapy as parthenogenetic stem cells.'] 

23287417 Biological effects of T315I-mutated BCR-ABL in an embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoiesis model.
['The occurrence of T315I mutation during the course of targeted therapies of chronic myeloid leukemia is a major concern because it confers resistance to all currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
The exact phenotype of the hematopoietic stem cell and the hierarchical level of the occurrence of this mutation in leukemic hematopoiesis has not been determined.
To study the effects of T315I-mutated breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell, we have used the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hematopoiesis model.
Native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL were introduced retrovirally in mESC-derived embryonic bodies followed by induction of hematopoiesis.
In several experiments, T315I-mutated and nonmutated BCR-ABL-transduced embryonic bodies rapidly generated hematopoietic cells on OP-9 feeders, with evidence of hematopoietic stem cell markers.
After injection into NOD/SCID mice, these cells induced myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, whereas transplantation of control (nontransduced) hematopoietic cells failed to produce any hematopoietic reconstitution in\xa0vivo.
Moreover, the expression of native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL conferred to mESC-derived hematopoietic cells a self-renewal capacity demonstrated by the generation of leukemias after secondary transplantations.
Secondary leukemias were more aggressive with evidence of extramedullary tumors.
The expression of stem cell regulator Musashi-2 was found to be increased in bone marrow of leukemic mice.
These data show that T315I-mutated BCR-ABL is functional at the stem cell level, conferring to mESC-derived leukemic cells a long-term hematopoietic repopulation ability.
This model could be of interest to test the efficiency of drugs at the stem cell level in leukemias with T315I mutation.'] 

25944056 Ctbp2 Modulates NuRD-Mediated Deacetylation of H3K27 and Facilitates PRC2-Mediated H3K27me3 in Active Embryonic Stem Cell Genes During Exit from Pluripotency.
['For cells to exit from pluripotency and commit to a lineage, the circuitry of a core transcription factor (CTF) network must be extinguished in an orderly manner through epigenetic modifications.
However, how this choreographed epigenetic remodeling at active embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes occurs during differentiation is poorly understood.
In this study, we demonstrate that C-terminal binding protein 2 (Ctbp2) regulates nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD)-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 and facilitates recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 in active ESC genes for exit from pluripotency during differentiation.
By genomewide analysis, we found that Ctbp2 resides in active ESC genes and co-occupies regions with ESC CTFs in undifferentiated ESCs.
Furthermore, ablation of Ctbp2 effects inappropriate gene silencing in ESCs by sustaining high levels of H3K27ac and impeding H3K27me3 in active ESC genes, thereby sustaining ESC maintenance during differentiation.
Thus, Ctbp2 preoccupies regions in active genes with the NuRD complex in undifferentiated ESCs that are directed toward H3K27me3 by PRC2 to induce stable silencing, which is pivotal for natural lineage commitment.'] 

25951976 BTG/Tob family members Tob1 and Tob2 inhibit proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells via Id3 mRNA degradation.
['The mammalian BTG/Tob family is a group of proteins with anti-proliferative ability, and there are six members including BTG1, BTG2/PC3/Tis21, BTG3/ANA, BTG4/PC3B, Tob1/Tob and Tob2.
Among them, Tob subfamily members, specifically Tob1/Tob and Tob2, have the most extensive C-terminal regions.
As previously reported, overexpression of BTG/Tob proteins is associated with the inhibition of G1 to S-phase cell cycle progression and decreased cell proliferation in a variety of cell types.
Tob subfamily proteins have similar anti-proliferative effects on cell cycle progression in cultured tumor cells.
An important unresolved question is whether or not they have function in rapidly proliferating cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Tob1 and
Tob2 were expressed ubiquitously in mouse ESCs (mESCs), suggesting a possible role in early embryonic development and mESCs.
To address the above question and explore the possible functions of the Tob subfamily in ESCs, we established ESCs from different genotypic knockout inner cell mass (ICM).
We found that Tob1(-/-), Tob2(-/-), and Tob1/2 double knockout (DKO, Tob1(-/-) & Tob2(-/-)) ESCs grew faster than wild type (WT)
ESCs without losing pluripotency, and we provide a possible mechanistic explanation for these observations: Tob1 and Tob2 inhibit the cell cycle via degradation of Id3 mRNA, which is a set of directly targeted genes of BMP4 signaling in mESCs that play critical roles in the maintenance of ESC properties.
Together, our data suggest that BTG/Tob family protein Tob1 and Tob2 regulation cell proliferation does not compromise the basic properties of mESCs.'] 

24966329 Antiviral responses in mouse embryonic stem cells: differential development of cellular mechanisms in type I interferon production and response.
['We have recently reported that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are deficient in expressing type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection and synthetic viral RNA analogs (Wang, R., Wang, J., Paul, A. M., Acharya, D., Bai, F., Huang, F., and Guo, Y. L. (2013) J. Biol.
Chem.
288, 15926-15936).
Here, we report that mESCs are able to respond to type I IFNs, express IFN-stimulated genes, and mediate the antiviral effect of type I IFNs against La Crosse virus and chikungunya virus.
The major signaling components in the IFN pathway are expressed in mESCs.
Therefore, the basic molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of type I IFNs are functional in mESCs; however, these mechanisms may not yet be fully developed as mESCs express lower levels of IFN-stimulated genes and display weaker antiviral activity in response to type I IFNs when compared with fibroblasts.
Further analysis demonstrated that type I IFNs do not affect the stem cell state of mESCs.
We conclude that mESCs are deficient in type I IFN expression, but they can respond to and mediate the cellular effects of type I IFNs.
These findings represent unique and uncharacterized properties of mESCs and are important for understanding innate immunity development and ESC physiology.'] 

25887270 Effect of LIF-withdrawal on acetylcholine synthesis in the embryonic stem cell line CGR8 is not mediated by STAT3, PI3Ks or cAMP/PKA pathways.
['Acetylcholine (ACh) acts as a local cellular signaling molecule and is widely expressed in nature, including mammalian cells and embryonic stem cells.
The murine embryonic stem cell line CGR8 synthesizes and releases substantial amounts of ACh.
Particularly during early differentiation - a period associated with multiple alterations in geno-/phenotype functions - synthesis and release of ACh are increased by 10-fold.
In murine stem cells second messengers of the STAT-3, PI3K and cAMP/PKA pathways are involved in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency.
The present experiments were designed to test whether blockers of these signaling pathways enhance ACh cell content in the presence of LIF, i.e. when CGR8 is pluripotent.
NSC74859, an inhibitor of STAT-3, affected neither the proliferation rate nor ACh cell content, whereas the more sensitive STAT-3 inhibitor FLLL31 reduced the proliferation rate and increased ACh cell content by about 3-fold.
The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the proliferation rate but did not modify the ACh cell content, whereas the PKA inhibitor H89 produced effects comparable to FLLL31.
Interestingly, in control experiments a strong inverse correlation was found between cell density and ACh cell content, which could explain the 3-fold increase in the ACh cell content observed in the presence of FLLL31 and H89.
Forskolin, a PKA activator, had no effect.
In conclusion, it appears unlikely that the 10-fold increase in ACh cell content induced by LIF removal, i.e. during early differentiation, is mediated by second messengers of the STAT-3, PI3K and cAMP/PKA pathways.
However, the PI3K pathway appears to be involved in control of the inverse relation between cell density and ACh cell content, because this correlation was significantly attenuated in the presence of LY294002.'] 

25873199 Assessment of the embryotoxicity of four Chinese herbal extracts using the embryonic stem cell test.
['Rhizoma Atractylodes macrocephala, Radix Isatidis, Coptis chinensis and Flos Genkwa are common herbal remedies used by pregnant woman in China.
In this study, their potential embryotoxicity was assessed using the embryonic stem cell test (EST) and a prediction model.
The potential embryotoxicity of the herbs was based on three endpoints: the concentrations of the compounds that inhibited the proliferation of 50% of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (IC50ES), the concentrations that inhibited 50% of 3T3 cells (IC503T3), and the concentrations that inhibited the differentiation of 50% of ESCs (ID50ES).
The results revealed that Rhizoma Atractylodes macrocephala and Radix Isatidis are non-embryotoxic compounds.
Coptis chinensis extracts appeared to demonstrated weak embryotoxicity, and Flos Genkwa exhibited strong embryotoxicity.
These results may be useful in guiding the clinical use of these herbs and in expanding the application of the EST to the field of traditional Chinese medicine.'] 

25393219 Nanog requires BRD4 to maintain murine embryonic stem cell pluripotency and is suppressed by bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 together with Lefty1.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are maintained in an undifferentiated state through expression of the core transcriptional factors Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2.
However, the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency is poorly understood.
Differentiation of ESCs is accompanied by a global reduction of panacetylation of histones H3 and H4 suggesting that histone acetylation plays an important role in maintenance of ESC pluripotency.
Acetylated lysine residues on histones are read by members of the bromodomain family that includes BET (bromodomain and extraterminal domain) proteins for which highly potent and selective inhibitors have been developed.
In this study we demonstrate that the pan-BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 induces rapid spontaneous differentiation of murine ESCs by inducing marked transcriptional downregulation of Nanog as well as the stemness markers Lefty1 and Lefty2, but not Myc, often used as a marker of BET inhibitor activity in cancer.
We show that the effects of JQ1 are recapitulated by knockdown of the BET family member BRD4 implicating this protein in Nanog regulation.
These data are also supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments which confirm BRD4 binding at the Nanog promoter that is known to require acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase MOF for transcriptional activity.
In further support of our findings, we show that JQ1 antagonizes the stem cell-promoting effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitors sodium butyrate and valproic acid.
Our data suggest that BRD4 is critical for the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and that this occurs primarily through the maintenance of Nanog expression.'] 

24022884 Expression of podocalyxin separates the hematopoietic and vascular potentials of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.
['In the mouse embryo and differentiating embryonic stem cells, the hematopoietic, endothelial, and cardiomyocyte lineages are derived from Flk1+ mesodermal progenitors.
Here, we report that surface expression of Podocalyxin (Podxl), a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins, can be used to subdivide the Flk1+ cells in differentiating embryoid bodies at day 4.75 into populations that develop into distinct mesodermal lineages.
Definitive hematopoietic potential was restricted to the Flk1+Podxl+ population, while the Flk1-negative Podxl+ population displayed only primitive erythroid potential.
The Flk1+Podxl-negative population contained endothelial cells and cardiomyocyte potential.
Podxl expression distinguishes Flk1+ mesoderm populations in mouse embryos at days 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 and is a marker of progenitor stage primitive erythroblasts.
These findings identify Podxl as a useful tool for separating distinct mesodermal lineages.'] 

25077841 Quantitative expression of pluripotency-related genes in parthenogenetically produced buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) embryos and in putative embryonic stem cells derived from them.
['Parthenogenetically produced embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from them offer a unique model for investigating the role of transcription factors in embryonic genome activation (EGA), pluripotent lineage specification and in pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells because of the unique nature of these embryos.

22895460 Controlling embryonic stem cell growth and differentiation by automation: enhanced and more reliable differentiation for drug discovery.
['Despite significant use in basic research, embryonic stem cells have just begun to be used in the drug discovery process.
Barriers to the adoption of embryonic stem cells in drug discovery include the difficulty in growing cells and inconsistent differentiation to the desired cellular phenotype.
Embryonic stem cell cultures require consistent and frequent handling to maintain the cells in a pluripotent state.
In addition, the preferred hanging drop method of embryoid body (EB) differentiation is not amenable to high-throughput methods, and suspension cultures of EBs show a high degree of variability.
Murine embryonic stem cells passaged on an automated platform maintained ≥ 90% viability and pluripotency.
We also developed a method of EB formation using 384-well microplates that form a single EB per well, with excellent uniformity across EBs.
This format facilitated high-throughput differentiation and enabled screens to optimize directed differentiation into a desired cell type.
Using this approach, we identified conditions that enhanced cardiomyocyte differentiation sevenfold.
This optimized differentiation method showed excellent consistency for such a complex biological process.
This automated approach to embryonic stem cell handling and differentiation can provide the high and consistent yields of differentiated cell types required for basic research, compound screens, and toxicity studies.'] 

24327412 Synthetic niches for differentiation of human embryonic stem cells bypassing embryoid body formation.
['The unique self-renewal and pluripotency features of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer the potential for unlimited development of novel cell therapies.
Currently, hESCs are cultured and differentiated using methods, such as monolayer culture and embryoid body (EB) formation.
As such, achieving efficient differentiation into higher order structures remains a challenge, as well as maintaining cell viability during differentiation into homogeneous cell populations.
Here, we describe the application of highly porous polymer scaffolds as synthetic stem cell niches.
Bypassing the EB formation step, these scaffolds are capable of three-dimensional culture of undifferentiated hESCs and subsequent directed differentiation into three primary germ layers.
H9 hESCs were successfully maintained and proliferated in biodegradable polymer scaffolds based on poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).
The results showed that cells within PLGA scaffolds retained characteristics of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells.
Moreover, the scaffolds allowed differentiation towards the lineage of interest by the addition of growth factors to the culture system.
The in vivo transplantation study revealed that the scaffolds could provide a microenvironment that enabled hESCs to interact with their surroundings, thereby promoting cell differentiation.
Therefore, this approach, which provides a unique culture/differentiation system for hESCs, will find its utility in various stem cell-based tissue-engineering applications.'] 

25411476 Polarized human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cell monolayers have higher resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death than nonpolarized cultures.
["Oxidative stress-mediated injury to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.
Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE cells are currently being evaluated for their potential for cell therapy in AMD patients through subretinal injection of cells in suspension and subretinal placement as a polarized monolayer.
To gain an understanding of how transplanted RPE cells will respond to the highly oxidatively stressed environment of an AMD patient eye, we compared the survival of polarized and nonpolarized RPE cultures following oxidative stress treatment.
Polarized, nonpolarized/confluent, nonpolarized/subconfluent hESC-RPE cells were treated with H2O2.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling stains revealed the highest amount of cell death in subconfluent hESC-RPE cells and little cell death in polarized hESC-RPE cells with H2O2 treatment.
There were higher levels of proapoptotic factors (phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, Bax, and
cleaved caspase 3 fragments) in treated nonpolarized RPE-particularly subconfluent cells-relative to polarized cells.
On the other hand, polarized RPE cells had constitutively higher levels of cell survival and antiapoptotic signaling factors such as p-Akt and Bcl-2, as well as antioxidants superoxide dismutase 1 and catalase relative to nonpolarized cells, that possibly contributed to polarized cells' higher tolerance to oxidative stress compared with nonpolarized RPE cells.
Subconfluent cells were particularly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
These results suggest that implantation of polarized hESC-RPE monolayers for treating AMD patients with geographic atrophy should have better survival than injections of hESC-RPE cells in suspension."] 

24312632 Inhibition of mitochondrial complex III blocks neuronal differentiation and maintains embryonic stem cell pluripotency.
['The mitochondrion is emerging as a key organelle in stem cell biology, acting as a regulator of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation.
In this study we sought to understand the effect of mitochondrial complex III inhibition during neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
When exposed to antimycin A, a specific complex III inhibitor, embryonic stem cells failed to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, maintaining high Oct4 levels even when subjected to a specific differentiation protocol.
Mitochondrial inhibition affected distinct populations of cells present in culture, inducing cell loss in differentiated cells, but not inducing apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells.
A reduction in overall proliferation rate was observed, corresponding to a slight arrest in S phase.
Moreover, antimycin A treatment induced a consistent increase in HIF-1α protein levels.
The present work demonstrates that mitochondrial metabolism is critical for neuronal differentiation and emphasizes that modulation of mitochondrial functions through pharmacological approaches can be useful in the context of controlling stem cell maintenance/differentiation.'] 

22345154 CDK8 maintains tumor dedifferentiation and embryonic stem cell pluripotency.
['CDK8 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that mediates transcriptional control of pathways linked to both cancer and stem cells.
In this study, we show that CDK8 is required for both tumor growth and maintenance of tumor dedifferentiation in vivo and uncover a common role for CDK8 in controlling cancer and stem cell function.
Acute CDK8 loss in vivo strongly inhibited tumor growth and promoted differentiation.
Transcriptional profiling identified a set of embryonic stem cell-related genes that are activated by CDK8 in cancer.
Consistent with this, we found that CDK8 expression correlated to the embryonic stem cell pluripotency state and loss of CDK8 caused embryonic stem cells to differentiate.
This effect was, at least partially, mediated by the ability of CDK8 to regulate MYC protein and downstream MYC target gene expression.
Similar regulation of MYC target genes by CDK8 was observed in colon tumor cells, and increased expression of a CDK8-regulated, embryonic stem cell MYC target gene signature was associated with loss of differentiation and poor outcome in primary human colon cancers.
Together, these observations reveal that CDK8 acts, at least in part, through MYC to maintain both tumors and embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state.
This raises the intriguing possibility that targeting CDK8 therapeutically may specifically inhibit the stem-like properties of cancer cells.'] 

24802396 Glutathione peroxidase-1 is required for self-renewal of murine embryonic stem cells.
['Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells that are capable of giving rise to any type of cells in the body and possess unlimited self-renewal potential.
However, the exact regulatory mechanisms that govern the self-renewal ability of ES cells remain elusive.
To understand the immediate early events during ES cell differentiation, we performed a proteomics study and analyzed the proteomic difference in murine ES cells before and after a 6-h spontaneous differentiation.
We found that the expression level of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), an antioxidant enzyme, is dramatically decreased upon the differentiation.
Both knockdown of GPx-1 expression with shRNA and inhibiting GPx-1 activity by inhibitor led to the differentiation of ES cells.
Furthermore, we showed that during early differentiation, the quick degradation of GPx-1 was mediated by proteasome.
Thus, our data indicated that GPx-1 is a key regulator of self-renewal of murine embryonic stem cells.']

26884329 The Role of Embryonic Stem Cell-expressed RAS (ERAS) in the Maintenance of Quiescent Hepatic Stellate Cells.
['Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were recently identified as liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells.
HSCs are activated after liver injury and involved in pivotal processes, such as liver development, immunoregulation, regeneration, and also fibrogenesis.
To date, several studies have reported candidate pathways that regulate the plasticity of HSCs during physiological and pathophysiological processes.
Here we analyzed the expression changes and activity of the RAS family GTPases and thereby investigated the signaling networks of quiescent HSCs versus activated HSCs.
For the first time, we report that embryonic stem cell-expressed RAS (ERAS) is specifically expressed in quiescent HSCs and down-regulated during HSC activation via promoter DNA methylation.
Notably, in quiescent HSCs, the high level of ERAS protein correlates with the activation of AKT, STAT3, mTORC2, and HIPPO signaling pathways and inactivation of FOXO1 and YAP. Our data strongly indicate that in quiescent HSCs, ERAS targets AKT via two distinct pathways driven by PI3Kα/δ and mTORC2, whereas in activated HSCs, RAS signaling shifts to RAF-MEK-ERK.
Thus, in contrast to the reported role of ERAS in tumor cells associated with cell proliferation, our findings indicate that ERAS is important to maintain quiescence in HSCs.']

24090592 Effect of bisphenol A on pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells and differentiation capacity in mouse embryoid bodies.
["Bisphenol A (BPA) poses potential risks to reproduction and development.
However, the mechanism of BPA's effects on early embryonic development is still unknown.
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) and embryoid bodies (EB) provide valuable in vitro models for testing the toxic effects of environmental chemicals in early embryogenesis.
In this study, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were acutely exposed to BPA for 24h, and general cytotoxicity and the effect of BPA on pluripotency were then evaluated.
Meanwhile, mouse embryoid bodies (mEB) were exposed to BPA up to 6 days and their differentiation capacity was evaluated.
In mESC and mEB, we found that BPA up-regulated pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) at mRNA and/or protein levels.
Moreover, BPA increased the mRNA levels of endodermal markers (Gata4,Sox17) and mesodermal markers (Sma,Desmin), and reduced the mRNA levels of ectodermal markers (Nestin,Fgf5) in mEB.
Furthermore, microRNA(miR)-134, an expression inhibitor of pluripotency markers including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, was decreased both in BPA-treated mESC and mEB. These results firstly indicate that BPA may disturb pluripotency in mESC and differentiation of mEB, and may inhibit ectodermal lineage differentiation of mEB while miR-134 may play a key role underlying this effect."] 

24780170 Optimizing human embryonic stem cells differentiation efficiency by screening size-tunable homogenous embryoid bodies.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are generally induced to differentiate by forming spherical structures termed embryoid bodies (EBs) in the presence of soluble growth factors.
hEBs are generated by suspending small clumps of hESC colonies; however, the resulting hEBs are heterogeneous because this method lacks the ability to control the number of cells in individual EBs.
This heterogeneity affects factors that influence differentiation such as cell-cell contact and the diffusion of soluble factors, and consequently, the differentiation capacity of each EB varies.
Here, we fabricated size-tunable concave microwells to control the physical environment, thereby regulating the size of EBs formed from single hESCs.
Defined numbers of single hESCs were forced to aggregate and generate uniformly sized EBs with high fidelity, and the size of the EBs was controlled using concave microwells of different diameters.
Differentiation patterns in H9- and CHA15-hESCs were affected by EB size in both the absence and presence of growth factors.
By screening EB size in the presence of various BMP4 concentrations, a two-fold increase in endothelial cell differentiation was achieved.
Because each hESC line has unique characteristics, the findings of this study demonstrate that concave microwells could be used to screen different EB sizes and growth factor concentrations to optimize differentiation for each hESC line.'] 

24949833 Mechanism of SB431542 in inhibiting mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['SB431542 (SB) is an established small molecular inhibitor that specifically binds to the ATP binding domains of the activin receptor-like kinase receptors, ALK5, ALK4 and ALK7, and thus specifically inhibits Smad2/3 activation and blocks TGF-β signal transduction.
SB maintains the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells.
However, the way of SB in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells remains unclear.
Considering that SB could not maintain embryonic stem cells pluripotency when leukemia inhibitory factor was withdrawn, we sought to identify the mechanism of SB on pluripotent maintenance.
Transcripts regulated by SB, including message RNAs and small non-coding RNAs were examined through microarray and deep-sequence experiments.
After examination, Western blot analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR verification, we found that SB regulated the transcript expressions related to self-renewal and differentiation.
SB mainly functioned by inhibiting differentiation.
The key pluripotent factors expression were not significantly affected by SB, and intrinsic differentiation-related transcripts including fibroblast growth factor family members, were significantly down-regulated by SB.
Moreover, SB could partially inhibit the retinoic acid response to neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.'] 

26302750 Association analysis between the distributions of histone modifications and gene expression in the human embryonic stem cell.
['It is well known that histone modifications are associated with gene expression.
In order to further study this relationship, 16 kinds of Chip-seq histone modification data and mRNA-seq data of the human embryonic stem cell H1 are chosen.
The distributions of histone modifications in the regions flanking transcription start sites (TSSs) for highly expressed and lowly expressed genes are computed, respectively.
And four types of distributions of histone modifications in regions flanking TSSs and the spatial patterning of the correlations between histone modifications and gene expression are detected.
Our results suggest that the correlations between the regions overlapped by peaks are higher than the non-overlapped ones for each histone modification.
In addition, to obtain the effect of the cooperative action of histone modification on gene expression, five histone modification clusters are found in highly expressed and lowly expressed genes, histone modification and gene expression interaction network is constructed.
To further explore which region is the main target region for the specific histone modification, the human genes are divided into five functional regions.
The results indicate that histone modifications are mostly located in the promoters of highly expressed genes versus the exons of lowly expressed genes, and exons have a smaller range of normalized tag counts than other gene elements in the two groups of genes.
Finally, the type specificity and regional bias of histone modifications for 11 key transcription factor genes regulating the stem cell renewal are analyzed.'] 

25045067 Expression of ganglioside 9-O acetyl GD3 in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
['Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) express a transient and heterogeneous pattern of molecules, which suggests a notable mechanism to control self-renewal avoid the differentiation into germ layers.
We show that 9-O-acetyl GD3 (9OacGD3), a highly expressed b-series ganglioside in neural stem (NS) cells, is expressed in undifferentiated mouse ES cells in a heterogeneous fashion.
After sorting, undifferentiated 9OacGD3(+) ES cell population had higher levels of nestin and Sox2 mRNA than the 9OacGD3(-) cells.
Even with elevated expression of these neural transcription factors, 9OacGD3(+) cells did not give rise to more neural progenitors than 9OacGD3(-) cells.
Expression of 9OacGD3 was recovered from 9OacGD3(-) cell population, demonstrating that expression of this ganglioside in mouse embryonic stem cells is transient, and does not reflect cell fate.
Our findings show that the ganglioside 9OacGD3 is expressed heterogeneously and transiently in ES cells, and this expression corresponds to higher levels of Sox2 and Nestin transcripts.'] 

26001961 A Bmp Reporter Transgene Mouse
Embryonic Stem Cell Model as a Tool to Identify and Characterize Chemical Teratogens.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were first isolated from mouse embryos more than 30 years ago.
They have proven invaluable not only in generating genetically modified mice that allow for analysis of gene function in tissue development and homeostasis but also as models for genetic disease.
In addition, ESCs in\xa0vitro are finding inroads in pharmaceutical and toxicological testing, including the identification of teratogenic compounds.
Here, we describe the use of a bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp)-reporter ESC line, isolated from a well-characterized transgenic mouse line, as a new tool for the identification of chemical teratogens.
The Bmp-mediated expression of the green fluorescent protein enabled the quantification of dose- and time-dependent effects of valproic acid as well as retinoic acid.
Significant effects were detectable at concentrations that were comparable to the ones observed in the classical embryonic stem cell test, despite the fact that the reporter gene is expressed in distinct cell types, including endothelial and endodermal cells.
Thus these cells provide a valuable new tool for the identification and characterization of relevant mechanisms of embryonic toxicity.'] 

25786529 Hand1-Luc embryonic stem cell test (Hand1-Luc EST): a novel rapid and highly reproducible in vitro test for embryotoxicity by measuring cytotoxicity and differentiation toxicity using engineered mouse ES cells.
['The embryonic stem cell test (EST) is a promising alternative method for evaluating embryotoxicity of test chemicals by measuring cytotoxicity and differentiation toxicity using mouse ES cells.
Differentiation toxicity is analyzed by microscopically counting the beating of embryonic bodies after 10 days of culture.
However, improvements are necessary to reduce the laborious manipulations involved and the time required to obtain results.
We have previously reported the successful stable transfection of ES cells (ES-D3) with the heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 1 (Hand1) gene and the establishment of a 96-well multi-plate-based new EST with luciferase reporter assay 6 days after treatment with test chemicals.
Now, we propose an even more rapid and easier EST, named Hand1-Luc EST. We established another cell line to monitor the Hand1 gene expression via a luciferase reporter gene.
By mRNA analysis and luciferase assay, we examined in detail the luciferase activity during cell differentiation, which allowed us to reduce the time of measurement from day 6 to day 5 (120 hr).
Furthermore, the protocol was improved, with, among others, the measurement of cytotoxicity and differentiation toxicity taking place in the same 96-well round bottom plate instead of two different plates.
With the positive control, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and 9 test chemicals, data with high reproducibility and very low variation (CV < 50%) in the relevant endpoints were obtained.
This study shows that the Hand1-Luc EST could provide an accurate and sensitive short-term test for prediction of embryotoxicants by measuring cytotoxicity and differentiation toxicity from the same sample.'] 

26130157 TRPV3 Channel Negatively Regulates Cell Cycle Progression and Safeguards the Pluripotency of Embryonic Stem Cells.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have tremendous potential for research and future therapeutic purposes.
However, the calcium handling mechanism in ESCs is not fully elucidated.
Aims of this study are (1) to investigate if transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 (TRPV3) channels are present in mouse ESCs (mESCs) and their subcellular localization; (2) to investigate the role of TRPV3 in maintaining the characteristics of mESCs.
Western blot and immunocytochemistry showed that TRPV3 was present at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mESCs.
Calcium imaging showed that, in the absence of extracellular calcium, TRPV3 activators camphor and 6-tert-butyl-m-cresol increased the cytosolic calcium.
However, depleting the ER store in advance of activator addition abolished the calcium increase, suggesting that TRPV3 released calcium from the ER. To dissect the functional role of TRPV3, TRPV3 was activated and mESC proliferation was measured by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays.
The results showed that TRPV3 activation led to a decrease in mESC proliferation.
Cell cycle analysis revealed that TRPV3 activation increased the percentage of cells in G2 /M phase; consistently, Western blot also revealed a concomitant increase in the expression of inactive form of cyclin-dependent kinase 1, suggesting that TRPV3 activation arrested mESCs at G2 /M phase.
TRPV3 activation did not alter the expression of pluripotency markers Oct-4, Klf4 and c-Myc, suggesting that the pluripotency was preserved.
Our study is the first study to show the presence of TRPV3 at ER. Our study also reveals the novel role of TRPV3 in controlling the cell cycle and preserving the pluripotency of ESCs.'] 

26551752 Integrative analysis of genes and miRNA alterations in human embryonic stem cells-derived neural cells after exposure to silver nanoparticles.
['Given the rapid growth of engineered and customer products made of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), understanding their biological and toxicological effects on humans is critically important.
The molecular developmental neurotoxic effects associated with exposure to Ag NPs were analyzed at the physiological and molecular levels, using an alternative cell model: human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs).
In this study, the cytotoxic effects of Ag NPs (10-200μg/ml) were examined in these hESC-derived NPCs, which have a capacity for neurogenesis in vitro, at 6 and 24h.
The results showed that Ag NPs evoked significant toxicity in hESC-derived NPCs at 24h in a dose-dependent manner.
In addition, Ag NPs induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following a significant increase in oxidative stress in these cells.
To further clarify the molecular mechanisms of the toxicological effects of Ag NPs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, the global expression profiles of genes and miRNAs were analyzed in hESC-derived NPCs after Ag NP exposure.
The results showed that Ag NPs induced oxidative stress and dysfunctional neurogenesis at the molecular level in hESC-derived NPCs.
Based on this hESC-derived neural cell model, these findings have increased our understanding of the molecular events underlying developmental neurotoxicity induced by Ag NPs in humans.'] 

22653738 Shear stress influences the pluripotency of murine embryonic stem cells in stirred suspension bioreactors.
['Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been used increasingly in research as primary material for various tissue-engineering applications.
Pluripotency, or the ability to give rise to all cells of the body, is an important characteristic of ESCs.
Traditional methods use leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) pluripotency in static and bioreactor cultures.
When LIF is removed from mESCs in static cultures, pluripotency genes are downregulated and the cultures will spontaneously differentiate.
Recently we have shown the maintenance of pluripotency gene expression of mESCs in stirred suspension bioreactors during differentiation experiments in the absence of LIF.
This is undesired in a differentiation experiment, where the goal is downregulation of pluripotency gene expression and upregulation of gene expression characteristic to the differentiation.
Thus, the objective of this study was to examine how effectively different levels of shear stress [100 rpm (6 dyne/cm(2) ), 60 rpm (3 dyne/cm(2) )] maintained and influenced pluripotency in suspension bioreactors.
The pluripotency markers Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2 and Rex-1 were assessed using gene expression profiles and flow-cytometry analysis and showed that shear stress does maintain and influence the gene expression of certain pluripotency markers.
Some significant differences between the two levels of shear stress were seen and the combination of shear stress and LIF was observed to synergistically increase the expression of certain pluripotency markers.
Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the environmental conditions within suspension bioreactors and how these conditions affect the pluripotency of mESCs.'] 

23948354 Individual and combined developmental toxicity assessment of bisphenol A and genistein using the embryonic stem cell test in vitro.
['The potential developmental toxicity of environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptors have become a great concern in recent years.
In this study, two typical environmental oestrogen, namely, bisphenol A (BPA) and genistein (GEN) were investigated for potential embryotoxicity using the embryonic stem cell test model.
Afterwards, a 4×4 full factorial design and the estimated marginal means plot were performed to assess the combined effects of these two compounds.
According to the linear discriminant functions and classification criteria, bisphenol A and genistein were classified as weakly embryotoxic and strongly embryotoxic respectively.
As for combined effects, the overall interaction between BPA and GEN on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiation was synergistic at low dosages, however, on ESCs and 3T3 cell proliferation, the predominate action was additive.
Considering the actual daily intake of these chemicals, it is concluded that BPA alone might not have adverse reproductive or developmental effects on human being.
However, given that BPA and GEN do have synergistic effect at low concentration, they may disturb normal embryo development together, which could result in birth defect and behavioral alterations later in life.']

['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), characterized by their ability to both self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell lineages, are a powerful model for biomedical research and developmental biology.
Human and mouse ESCs share many features, yet have distinctive aspects, including fundamental differences in the signaling pathways and cell cycle controls that support self-renewal.
Here, we explore the molecular basis of human ESC self-renewal using Bayesian network machine learning to integrate cell-type-specific, high-throughput data for gene function discovery.
We integrated high-throughput ESC data from 83 human studies (~1.8 million data points collected under 1,100 conditions) and 62 mouse studies (~2.4 million data points collected under 1,085 conditions) into separate human and mouse predictive networks focused on ESC self-renewal to analyze shared and distinct functional relationships among protein-coding gene orthologs.
Computational evaluations show that these networks are highly accurate, literature validation confirms their biological relevance, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation supports our predictions.
Our results reflect the importance of key regulatory genes known to be strongly associated with self-renewal and pluripotency in both species (e.g., POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG), identify metabolic differences between species (e.g., threonine metabolism), clarify differences between human and mouse ESC developmental signaling pathways (e.g., leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-activated JAK/STAT in mouse; NODAL/ACTIVIN-A-activated fibroblast growth factor in human), and reveal many novel genes and pathways predicted to be functionally associated with self-renewal in each species.

23649898 Repression of global protein synthesis by Eif1a-like genes that are expressed specifically in the two-cell embryos and the transient Zscan4-positive state of embryonic stem cells.
['Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are prototypical stem cells that remain undifferentiated in culture for long periods, yet maintain the ability to differentiate into essentially all cell types.
Previously, we have reported that ES cells oscillate between two distinct states, which can be distinguished by the transient expression of Zscan4 genes originally identified for its specific expression in mouse two-cell stage embryos.
Here, we report that the nascent protein synthesis is globally repressed in the Zscan4-positive state of ES cells, which is mediated by the transient expression of newly identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (Eif1a)-like genes.
Eif1a-like genes, clustered on Chromosome 12, show the high sequence similarity to the Eifa1 and consist of 10 genes (Eif1al1-Eif1al10) and 9 pseudogenes (Eif1al-ps1-Eif1al-ps9).
The analysis of the expressed sequence tag database showed that Eif1a-like genes are expressed mostly in the two-cell stage mouse embryos.
Microarray analyses and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses show that Eif1a-like genes are expressed specifically in the Zscan4-positive state of ES cells.
These results indicate a novel mechanism to repress protein synthesis by Eif1a-like genes and a unique mode of protein synthesis regulation in ES cells, which undergo a transient and reversible repression of global protein synthesis in the Zscan4-positive state.']

In contrast to what was observed previously using fetus-derived NPCs, infection of ES cell-derived pNSCs with HCMV was nonprogressive.

IE expression was found to be restricted to cells negative for the anterior marker FORSE-1, and treatment of pNSCs with retinoic acid restored IE expression.
Differentiation of pNSCs into NPCs restored IE expression but not the transactivation of early genes.
Virions produced in NPCs and pNSCs were exclusively cell associated and were mostly non-neural tropic.
Finally, we found that viral genomes could persist in pNSC cultures for up to a month after infection despite the absence of detectable IE expression by immunofluorescence, and infectious virus could be produced upon differentiation of pNSCs to neurons.

25273540 Cartilage repair using human embryonic stem cell-derived chondroprogenitors.
['In initial work, we developed a 14-day culture protocol under potential GMP, chemically defined conditions to generate chondroprogenitors from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
The present study was undertaken to investigate the cartilage repair capacity of these cells.
The chondrogenic protocol was optimized and validated with gene expression profiling.
The protocol was also applied successfully to two lines of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
Chondrogenic cells derived from hESCs were encapsulated in fibrin gel and implanted in osteochondral defects in the patella groove of nude rats, and cartilage repair was evaluated by histomorphology and immunocytochemistry.
Genes associated with chondrogenesis were upregulated during the protocol, and pluripotency-related genes were downregulated.
Aggregation of chondrogenic cells was accompanied by high expression of SOX9 and strong staining with Safranin O. Culture with PluriSln1 was lethal for hESCs but was tolerated by hESC chondrogenic cells, and no OCT4-positive cells were detected in hESC chondrogenic cells.
iPSCs were also shown to generate chondroprogenitors in this protocol.
Repaired tissue in the defect area implanted with hESC-derived chondrogenic cells was stained for collagen II with little collagen I, but negligible collagen II was observed in the fibrin-only controls.
Viable human cells were detected in the repair tissue at 12 weeks.
The results show that chondrogenic cells derived from hESCs, using a chemically defined culture system, when implanted in focal defects were able to promote cartilage repair.

23307500 Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes define gene expression patterns in pluripotent and differentiating embryonic stem cells.
['Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes are associated with various phenotypes, such as altered susceptibility to disease, environmental adaptations, and aging.
Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial DNA is essential for cell differentiation and the cell phenotype.
However, the effects of different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes on differentiation and development remain to be determined.
Using embryonic stem cell lines possessing the same Mus musculus chromosomes but harboring one of Mus musculus, Mus spretus, or Mus terricolor mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, we have determined the effects of different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes on chromosomal gene expression, differentiation, and mitochondrial metabolism.
In undifferentiated and differentiating embryonic stem cells, we observed mitochondrial DNA haplotype-specific expression of genes involved in pluripotency, differentiation, mitochondrial energy metabolism, and DNA methylation.
These mitochondrial DNA haplotypes also influenced the potential of embryonic stem cells to produce spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes.
The differences in gene expression patterns and cardiomyocyte production were independent of ATP content, oxygen consumption, and respiratory capacity, which until now have been considered to be the primary roles of mitochondrial DNA. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells harboring the different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in a 3D environment significantly increased chromosomal gene expression for all haplotypes during differentiation.
However, haplotype-specific differences in gene expression patterns were maintained in this environment.
Taken together, these results provide significant insight into the phenotypic consequences of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and demonstrate their influence on differentiation and development.
We propose that mitochondrial DNA haplotypes play a pivotal role in the process of differentiation and mediate the fate of the cell.']

26815535 MycN Is Critical for the Maintenance of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Neural Crest Stem Cells.
['The biologic studies of human neural crest stem cells (hNCSCs) are extremely challenging due to the limited source of hNCSCs as well as ethical and technical issues surrounding isolation of early human embryonic tissues.
On the other hand, vast majority of studies on MycN have been conducted in human tumor cells, thus, the role of MycN in normal human neural crest development is completely unknown.
In the present study, we determined the role of MycN in hNCSCs isolated from in vitro-differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
For the first time, we show that suppression of MycN in hNCSCs inhibits cell growth and cell cycle progression.
Knockdown of MycN in hNCSCs increases the expression of Cdkn1a, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinases p21CIP1, p16 INK4a and p15INK4b.
In addition, MycN is involved in the regulation of human sympathetic neurogenesis, as knockdown of MycN enhances the expression of key transcription factors involved in sympathetic neuron differentiation, including Phox2a, Phox2b, Mash1, Hand2 and Gata3.
We propose that unlimited source of hNCSCs provides an invaluable platform for the studies of human neural crest development and diseases.'] 

27345997 Generation of a transgenic human embryonic stem cell line ectopically expressing the endosomal protein Asrij that regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells: BJNhem20-Asrij.
['Asrij is an endocytic protein expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and is essential for maintenance of stemness of mESCs (Mukhopadhyay et al.

Its human ortholog named Ovarian Carcinoma Immuno-reactive Antigen domain containing protein 1 (OCIAD1) is 85% identical.
We ectopically expressed Asrij in epiblast stage equivalent-human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to test for induction of naive pluripotency in primed pluripotent cells.
The construct pCAG-Asrij was introduced into hESCs by microporation.
Ectopic expression of Asrij in BJNhem20 hESC line was performed by selecting for plasmid transfection, followed by stable cell line generation.'] 

25491368 Vitamin C induces a pluripotent state in mouse embryonic stem cells by modulating microRNA expression.
['MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of noncoding RNAs, function as post-transcriptional gene regulators and control the establishment, self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells.
Vitamin C has been recognized as a reprogramming enhancer because of its ability to induce a blastocyst-like state in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
However, knowledge on the regulation of miRNAs by vitamin C in ESCs is limited.
In this study, we found that vitamin C induced miRNA expression, particularly of ESC-specific miRNAs.
Moreover, vitamin C maintained the miRNA expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinting region.
The miRNAs in this region contain identical seed sequences, which target a class of genes, including Kdm6b, Klf13, and Sox6, and are mainly related to cell differentiation and development.
These genes were significantly downregulated by vitamin C.
Notably, miR-143 promoted self-renewal of mouse ESCs and suppressed expression of the de novo methyltransferase gene Dnmt3a.
Knockdown of miR-143 by use of its inhibitor counteracted the vitamin C-induced reduction in Dnmt3a expression, showing that vitamin C repressed Dnmt3a expression via miR-143.
Vitamin C also promoted DNA demethylation, including of pluripotency gene promoters (Tbx3, Tcl1, and Esrrb) and ESC-specific miRNA promoters (miR-290-295 and miR-17-92 clusters), and DNA hydroxymethylation, including of the intergenic differentially methylated region of the Dlk1-Dio3 region.
These results strongly suggested that vitamin C promoted widespread DNA demethylation in gene promoters by modulating epigenetic modifiers, including Dnmt3a, which activated pluripotency genes and ESC-specific miRNAs.
Then, differentiation and development genes were repressed by ESC-enriched miRNAs, which maintained the stem cell state.'] 

24923762 Selective TGF-β1/ALK inhibitor improves neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['The transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a polypeptide member of the TGF-β superfamily, has myriad cellular functions, including cell fate differentiation.
We hypothesized that suppression of TGF-β1 signaling would improve the efficacy of neuronal differentiation during embryoid body (EB) development.
In this study, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were allowed to differentiate into their neuronal lineage, both with, and without the TGF-β1 inhibitor (A83-01).
After 8 days of EB suspension culture, the samples were examined by morphological analysis, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry with pluripotent (Oct4, Sox2) and neuronal specific markers (Pax6, NeuN).
The alteration of gene expressions during EB development was determined by quantitative RT-PCR.
Our results revealed that the TGF-β1/ALK inhibitor potentially suppressed pluripotent gene (Oct4) during a rapidly up-regulation of neuronal associated genes including Sox1 and MAP2.
Strikingly, during EB development, the expression of GFAP, the astrocyte specific gene, remarkably decreased compared to the non-treated control.
This strategy demonstrated the beneficial function of TGF-β1/ALK inhibitor that rapidly and uniformly drives cell fate alteration from pluripotent state toward neuronal lineages.'] 

24183167 Nanotopographical control for maintaining undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell colonies in feeder free conditions.
['Recently emerging evidence has indicated surface nanotopography as an important physical parameter in the stem cell niche for regulating cell fate and behaviors for various types of stem cells.
In this study, a substrate featuring arrays of increasing nanopillar diameter was devised to investigate the effects of varying surface nanotopography on the maintenance of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies in the absence of feeder cells.
Single hESCs cultured across gradient nanopattern (G-Np) substrate were generally organized into compact colonies, and expressed higher levels of undifferentiated markers compared to those cultured on the unstructured control substrate.
In particular, hESC demonstrates a propensity to organize into more compact colonies expressing higher levels of undifferentiated markers towards a smaller nanopillar diameter range (D = 120-170 nm).
Cell-nanotopography interactions modulated the formation of focal adhesions and cytoskeleton reorganization to restrict colony spreading, which reinforced E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesions in hESC colonies.
Maintaining compact hESC colony integrity revealed to be indispensable for hESC undifferentiated state as the loss of cell-cell adhesions within spreading hESC on the control substrate exhibited morphological and gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like processes.
Findings in this study demonstrated a feasible approach to screen the optimal nanotopographical cues for maintaining undifferentiated hESC colonies in feeder free conditions, which provides a platform for further investigations into developing hESC feeder free culture systems for the purpose of regenerative medicine.'] 

25074424 Novel cell lines isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells exhibiting de novo methylation of the E-cadherin promoter.
['Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and epiblast stem cells represent the naïve and primed pluripotent states, respectively.
These cells self-renew via distinct signaling pathways and can transition between the two states in the presence of appropriate growth factors.
Manipulation of signaling pathways has therefore allowed the isolation of novel pluripotent cell types such as Fibroblast growth factor, Activin and BIO-derived stem cells and IESCs.
However, the effect of cell seeding density on pluripotency remains unexplored.
In this study, we have examined whether mESCs can epigenetically regulate E-cadherin to enter a primed-like state in response to low cell seeding density.
We show that low density seeding in the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces decreased apoptosis and maintenance of pluripotency via Activin/Nodal, concomitant with loss of E-cadherin, Signal transducer and activator of transcription phosphorylation, and chimera-forming ability.
These cells, E-cadherin negative proliferating stem cells (ENPSCs) can be reverted to a naïve phenotype by addition of LIF or forced E-cadherin expression.
However, prolonged culture of ENPSCs without LIF leads to methylation of the E-cadherin promoter (ENPSC(M)), which cannot be reversed by LIF supplementation, and increased histone H3K27 and decreased H3K4 trimethylation.
Transcript analysis of ENPSC(M) revealed a primed-like phenotype and their differentiation leads to enrichment of neuroectoderm cells.
The generation of ENPSCs is similar to tumorigenesis as ENPSCs exhibit transcript alterations associated with neoplasia, hyperplasia, carcinoma, and metastasis.
We therefore describe a novel cell model to elucidate the role of E-cadherin in pluripotency and to investigate epigenetic regulation of this gene during mESC differentiation and tumor metastasis.'] 

25385436 Functional compensation between Myc and PI3K signaling supports self-renewal of embryonic stem cells.
['c-Myc and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) both participate in diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle control and tumorigenic transformation.
They also contribute to preserving embryonic stem cell (ESC) characteristics.
However, in spite of the vast knowledge, the molecular relationship between c-Myc and PI3K in ESCs is not known.
Herein, we demonstrate that c-Myc and PI3K function cooperatively but independently to support ESC self-renewal when murine ESCs are cultured under conventional culture condition.
Interestingly, culture of ESCs in 2i-condition including a GSK3β and MEK inhibitor renders both PI3K and Myc signaling dispensable for the maintenance of pluripotent properties.
These results suggest that the requirement for an oncogenic proliferation-dependent mechanism sustained by Myc and PI3K is context dependent and that the 2i-condition liberates ESCs from the dependence of this mechanism.'] 

24648413 Retinoic acid suppresses the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in embryonic stem cells and activates the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have both the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into various cell lineages.
Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of Vitamin A, has a critical function in initiating lineage differentiation of ESCs through binding to the retinoic acid receptors.
Additionally, the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in pluripotency and differentiation, depending on the activation status of the canonical and noncanonical pathways.
The activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which requires the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its interaction with Tcf1/Lef at Wnt response elements, is involved in ESC stemness maintenance.
The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway.
We show that RA activates the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, while concomitantly inhibiting the canonical pathway.
RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression.
RA reduces the phosphorylated β-catenin levels by fourfold, although total β-catenin levels do not change.
We show that RA signaling increases the dissociation of Tcf1 and the association of Tcf3 at promoters of genes that regulate stemness (e.g., NR5A2, Lrh-1) or differentiation (e.g. Cyr61, Zic5).
Knockdown of Tcf3 increases Lrh-1 transcript levels in mESCs and prevents the RA-associated, fourfold increase in Zic5, indicating that RA requires Tcf3 to effect changes in Zic5 levels.
We demonstrate a novel role for RA in altering the activation of these two Wnt signaling pathways and show that Tcf3 mediates some actions of RA during differentiation.'] 

24232252 Contralaterally transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells (ENStem-A) migrate and improve brain functions in stroke-damaged rats.
['The transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is known to be a promising approach to ameliorating behavioral deficits after stroke in a rodent model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).
Previous studies have shown that transplanted NPCs migrate toward the infarct region, survive and differentiate into mature neurons to some extent.
However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of NPC migration following transplantation into stroke animals have yet to be elucidated.
In this study, we investigated the fates of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived NPCs (ENStem-A) for 8 weeks following transplantation into the side contralateral to the infarct region using 7.0T animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T2- and T2*-weighted MRI analyses indicated that the migrating cells were clearly detectable at the infarct boundary zone by 1 week, and the intensity of the MRI signals robustly increased within 4 weeks after transplantation.
Afterwards, the signals were slightly increased or unchanged.
At 8 weeks, we performed Prussian blue staining and immunohistochemical staining using human-specific markers, and found that high percentages of transplanted cells migrated to the infarct boundary.
Most of these cells were CXCR4-positive.
We also observed that the migrating cells expressed markers for various stages of neural differentiation, including Nestin, Tuj1, NeuN, TH, DARPP-32 and SV38, indicating that the transplanted cells may partially contribute to the reconstruction of the damaged neural tissues after stroke.
Interestingly, we found that the extent of gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells) and apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cells) were significantly decreased in the cell-transplanted group, suggesting that hESC-NPCs have a positive role in reducing glia scar formation and cell death after stroke.
No tumors formed in our study.
We also performed various behavioral tests, including rotarod, stepping and modified neurological severity score tests, and found that the transplanted animals exhibited significant improvements in sensorimotor functions during the 8 weeks after transplantation.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that hESC-NPCs have the capacity to migrate to the infarct region, form neural tissues efficiently and contribute to behavioral recovery in a rodent model of ischemic stroke.'] 

24931943 Role of cell-cell adhesion complexes in embryonic stem cell biology.
['Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can self-renew or differentiate into any cell type within an organism.
Here, we focus on the roles of cadherins and catenins - their cytoplasmic scaffold proteins - in the fate, maintenance and differentiation of mammalian ESCs.
E-cadherin is a master stem cell regulator that is required for both mouse ESC (mESC) maintenance and differentiation.
E-cadherin interacts with key components of the naive stemness pathway and ablating
it prevents stem cells from forming well-differentiated teratomas or contributing to chimeric animals.
In addition, depleting E-cadherin converts naive mouse ESCs into primed epiblast-like stem cells (EpiSCs).
In line with this, a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) occurs during reprogramming of somatic cells towards induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), leading to downregulation of N-cadherin and acquisition of high E-cadherin levels.
β-catenin exerts a dual function; it acts in cadherin-based adhesion and in WNT signaling and, although WNT signaling is important for stemness, the adhesive function of β-catenin might be crucial for maintaining the naive state of stem cells.
In addition, evidence is rising that other junctional proteins are also important in ESC biology.
Thus, precisely regulated levels and activities of several junctional proteins, in particular E-cadherin, safeguard naive pluripotency and are a prerequisite for complete somatic cell reprogramming.'] 

23963623 Akt suppression of TGFβ signaling contributes to the maintenance of vascular identity in embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells.
['The ability to generate and maintain stable in vitro cultures of mouse endothelial cells (ECs) has great potential for genetic dissection of the numerous pathologies involving vascular dysfunction as well as therapeutic applications.
However, previous efforts at achieving sustained cultures of primary stable murine vascular cells have fallen short, and the cellular requirements for EC maintenance in vitro remain undefined.
In this study, we have generated vascular ECs from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that active Akt is essential to their survival and propagation as homogeneous monolayers in vitro.
These cells harbor the phenotypical, biochemical, and functional characteristics of ECs and expand throughout long-term cultures, while maintaining their angiogenic capacity.
Moreover, Akt-transduced embryonic ECs form functional perfused vessels in vivo that anastomose with host blood vessels.
We provide evidence for a novel function of Akt in stabilizing EC identity, whereby the activated form of the protein protects mouse ES cell-derived ECs from TGFβ-mediated transdifferentiation by downregulating SMAD3.
These findings identify a role for Akt in regulating the developmental potential of ES cell-derived ECs and demonstrate that active Akt maintains endothelial identity in embryonic ECs by interfering with active TGFβ-mediated processes that would ordinarily usher these cells to alternate fates.'] 

24788136 Human embryonic stem cell derived islet progenitors mature inside an encapsulation device without evidence of increased biomass or cell escape.
['There are several challenges to successful implementation of a cell therapy for insulin dependent diabetes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC).
Among these are development of functional insulin producing cells, a clinical delivery method that eliminates the need for chronic immunosuppression, and assurance that hESC derived tumors do not form in the patient.
We and others have shown that encapsulation of cells in a bilaminar device (TheraCyte) provides immunoprotection in rodents and primates.
Here we monitored human insulin secretion and employed bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to evaluate the maturation, growth, and containment of encapsulated islet progenitors derived from CyT49 hESC, transplanted into mice.
Human insulin was detectable by 7 weeks post-transplant and increased 17-fold over the course of 8 weeks, yet during this period the biomass of encapsulated cells remained constant.
Remarkably, by 20 weeks post-transplant encapsulated cells secreted sufficient levels of human insulin to ameliorate alloxan induced diabetes.
Further, bioluminescent imaging revealed for the first time that hESCs remained fully contained in encapsulation devices for up to 150 days, the longest period tested.
Collectively, the data suggest that encapsulated hESC derived islet progenitors hold great promise as an effective and safe cell replacement therapy for insulin dependent diabetes.'] 

22897387 Human embryonic stem cell differentiation into insulin secreting β-cells for diabetes.
['hESC (human embryonic stem cells), when differentiated into pancreatic β ILC (islet-like clusters), have enormous potential for the cell transplantation therapy for Type 1 diabetes.
We have developed a five-step protocol in which the EBs (embryoid bodies) were first differentiated into definitive endoderm and subsequently into pancreatic lineage followed by formation of functional endocrine β islets, which were finally matured efficiently under 3D conditions.
The conventional cytokines activin A and RA (retinoic acid) were used initially to obtain definitive endoderm.
In the last step, ILC were further matured under 3D conditions using amino acid rich media (CMRL media) supplemented with anti-hyperglycaemic hormone-Glp1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) analogue Liraglutide with prolonged t(½) and Exendin 4.
The differentiated islet-like 3D clusters expressed bonafide mature and functional β-cell markers-PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homoeobox-1), C-peptide, insulin and MafA. Insulin synthesis de novo was confirmed by C-peptide ELISA of culture supernatant in response to varying concentrations of glucose as well as agonist and antagonist of functional 3D β islet cells in vitro.
Our results indicate the presence of almost 65% of insulin producing cells in 3D clusters.
The cells were also found to ameliorate hyperglycaemia in STZ (streptozotocin) induced diabetic NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency) mouse up to 96 days of transplantation.
This protocol provides a basis for 3D in vitro generation of long-term in vivo functionally viable islets from hESC.'] 

24121003 Gene expression profiling reveals the heterogeneous transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 and its possible interaction with Gli2 in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['We examined the transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 (Pou5f1) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) maintained under standard culture conditions to gain a better understanding of self-renewal in mESCs.
First, we built an expression vector in which the Oct3/4 promoter drives the monocistronic transcription of Venus and a puromycin-resistant gene via the foot-and-mouth disease virus self-cleaving peptide T2A. Then, a genetically-engineered mESC line with the stable integration of this vector was isolated and cultured in the presence or absence of puromycin.
The cultures were subsequently subjected to Illumina expression microarray analysis.
We identified approximately 4600 probes with statistically significant differential expression.
The genes involved in nucleic acid synthesis were overrepresented in the probe set associated with mESCs maintained in the presence of puromycin.
In contrast, the genes involved in cell differentiation were overrepresented in the probe set associated with mESCs maintained in the absence of puromycin.
Therefore, it is suggested with these data that the transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 fluctuates in mESCs and that Oct3/4 plays an essential role in sustaining the basal transcriptional activities required for cell duplication in populations with equal differentiation potential.
Heterogeneity in the transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 was dynamic.
Interestingly, we found that genes involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway showed unique expression profiles in mESCs and validated this observation by RT-PCR analysis.
The expression of Gli2, Ptch1 and Smo was consistently detected in other types of pluripotent stem cells examined in this study.
Furthermore, the Gli2 protein was heterogeneously detected in mESC nuclei by immunofluorescence microscopy and this result correlated with the detection of the Oct3/4 protein.
Finally, forced activation of Gli2 in mESCs increased their proliferation rate.
Collectively, it is suggested with these results that Gli2 may play a novel role in the self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells.'] 

25036750 Accelerated neuronal differentiation toward motor neuron lineage from human embryonic stem cell line (H9).
['Motor neurons loss plays a pivotal role in the pathoetiology of various debilitating diseases such as, but not limited to, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.
However, advancement in motor neuron replacement therapy has been significantly constrained by the difficulties in large-scale production at a cost-effective manner.
Current methods to derive motor neuron heavily rely on biochemical stimulation, chemical biological screening, and complex physical cues.
These existing methods are seriously challenged by extensive time requirements and poor yields.
An innovative approach that overcomes prior hurdles and enhances the rate of successful motor neuron transplantation in patients is of critical demand.
Iron, a trace element, is indispensable for the normal development and function of the central nervous system.
Whether ferric ions promote neuronal differentiation and subsequently promote motor neuron lineage has never been considered.
Here, we demonstrate that elevated iron concentration can drastically accelerate the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward motor neuron lineage potentially via a transferrin mediated pathway.
HB9 expression in 500\u2009nM iron-treated hESCs is approximately twofold higher than the control.
Moreover, iron treatment generated more matured and functional motor neuron-like cells that are ∼1.5 times more sensitive to depolarization when compared to the control.
Our methodology renders an expedited approach to harvest motor neuron-like cells for disease, traumatic injury regeneration, and drug screening.']

25301940 Serum Inter-α-inhibitor activates the Yes tyrosine kinase and YAP/TEAD transcriptional complex in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['We have previously demonstrated that the Src family kinase Yes, the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TEA domain TEAD2 transcription factor pathway are activated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and contribute to mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal.
In addition, we have shown that fetal bovine serum (FBS) induces Yes auto-phosphorylation and activation.
In the present study we confirm that serum also activates TEAD-dependent transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and we identify Inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) as a component in serum capable of activating the Yes/YAP/TEAD pathway by inducing Yes auto-phosphorylation, YAP nuclear localization and TEAD-dependent transcription.
The cleaved heavy chain 2 (HC2) sub-component of IαI, is demonstrated to be responsible for this effect.
Moreover, IαI is also shown to efficiently increase expression of TEAD-downstream target genes including well-known stem cell factors Nanog and Oct 3/4.
IαI is not produced by the ES cells per se but is added to the cells via the cell culture medium containing serum or serum-derived components such as bovine serum albumin (BSA).
In conclusion, we describe a novel function of IαI in activating key pluripotency pathways associated with ES cell maintenance and self-renewal.'] 

22674886 Effect of basic fibroblast growth factor in mouse embryonic stem cell culture and osteogenic differentiation.
['Embryonic stem cells are actively explored as a cell source in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine involving bone repair.
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been a valuable growth factor to support the culture of human stem cells as well as their osteogenic differentiation, but the influence of bFGF on mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells is not known.
Towards this goal, D3 cells were treated with bFGF during maintenance conditions and during spontaneous and osteogenic differentiation.
In feeder-free monolayers, up to 40\u2009ng/ml of exogenous bFGF did not support self-renewal of mES without LIF during cell expansion.
During spontaneous differentiation in high-density cultures, bFGF stimulated cell proliferation under certain conditions but did not influence differentiation, as judged by stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 expression.
The addition of bFGF reduced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity associated with osteoblast activity during differentiation induced by osteogenic supplements, although the extent of mineralization was unaffected by bFGF.
The bFGF increased the mesenchymal stem cell marker Sca-1 in an mES cell population and led to an enhanced increase in osteocalcin and runx2 expression in combination with BMP-2.
These results suggest that bFGF could be utilized to expand the cell population in high-density cultures in addition to enriching the BMP-2 responsiveness of mES cells.']

26026884 Resolving Heterogeneity: Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting of Dynamic Cell Populations from Feeder-Free Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Culture.
['Embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture comprises a mixture of cells that are primed to differentiate into different lineages.
In conditions where ESCs self-renew, these primed populations continuously interconvert and consequently show highly dynamic coordinated changes in their expression of different sets of pluripotency and differentiation markers.
It has become increasingly apparent that this transcriptional heterogeneity is an important characteristic of ESC culture.
By sorting for specific populations of ESCs it is possible to enrich for cells with a capacity to colonize the embryo proper or the extra-embryonic lineages such as the descendents of the primitive endoderm or trophoblast.
Here, we describe a method of isolating specific sub-sets of ESCs from the pluripotent cells present in in vitro ESC culture using SSEA1 antibody staining in combination with reporter lines and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).']

Nanofibers Maintain Embryonic Stem Cell Stemness via TGF-Beta Signaling.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into any cell type, thus making them the focus of many clinical application studies.
Culturing ESCs on mouse embryonic fibroblast-derived and cell-based feeder layers to maintain pluripotency is a standard laboratory procedure.
However, xenogeneic contamination and the large amount of time required for feeder cell preparation are two challenges that encourage the use of a murine-based feeder layer.
A novel biomaterial is required to replace the current cell-based feeder system.
Toward this goal, we applied a combination of biocompatible polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and electrospinning technology to establish a non-cell-based feeder layer.
According to results from stem cell marker staining, scanning electron microscopy, and embryoid body formation tests, optimal ESC stemness and pluripotency were noted in three electrospun groups (2, 4, and 8 minutes), with the longer electrospinning times producing higher feeder-layer densities.
KEGG pathway microarray results identified TGF-beta signaling as one of the major deregulatory pathways on electrospun-based feeder layers.
Western blot data indicate significant increases in TGF-beta receptor II, phosphorylated Smad3, and Nanog protein levels in the 4- and 8-minute electrospun-based feeder layer groups compared to the non-feeder layer group.
Combined, the data suggest that electrospun-based feeder layers are good candidates for maintaining ESC and iPSC pluripotency in clinical applications.']

25340537 Directed mouse embryonic stem cells into leydig-like cells rescue testosterone-deficient male rats in vivo.
["The primary function of Leydig cells is to secrete testosterone, which is critical in the regulation of male reproduction and development.
Low levels of testosterone will lead to male hypogonadism.
Stem cell-derived Leydig cell transplantation may be a promising alternative therapy for male hypogonadism.
Thus far, others have reported that Leydig-like cells can be derived from mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells.
However, the efficiency of the differentiating Leydig cells remains low, and progress toward generating functional adult Leydig cells (ALCs) is limited.
Herein, we describe a robust method of directing differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into Leydig-like cells in vitro by overexpression of the transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and treatment with a combination of 8-Bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and forskolin.
These differentiated cells express mRNA encoding the steroidogenic enzymes and produce progesterone and testosterone.
Importantly, when transplanted into male rats that had their original Leydig cells selectively eliminated by ethylene dimethanesulfonate, these in vitro-derived Leydig-like cells further developed into functional ALCs that rescued serum testosterone levels.
These data provide evidence that mESCs can be induced to differentiate into Leydig-like cells in vitro, which can develop in the in vivo microenvironment."] 

25047539 Granulosa cells and retinoic acid co-treatment enrich potential germ cells from manually selected Oct4-EGFP expressing human embryonic stem cells.
['Differentiation of human embryonic stem (HES) cells to germ cells may become clinically useful in overcoming diseases related to germ-cell development.
Niches were used to differentiate HES cell lines, NTU1 and H9 Oct4-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), including laminin, granulosa cell co-culture or conditioned medium, ovarian stromal cell co-culture or conditioned medium, retinoic acid, stem cell factor (SCF) and BMP4-BMP7-BMP8b treatment.
Flow cytometry showed that granulosa cell co-culture (P < 0.001) or conditioned medium (P = 0.007) treatment for 14 days significantly increased the percentages of differentiated H9 Oct4-EGFP cells expressing early germ cell marker stage-specific embryonic antigen 1(SSEA1); sorted SSEA1[+] cells did not express higher levels of germ cell gene VASA and GDF9.
Manually collected H9 Oct4-EGFP[+] cells expressed significantly higher levels of VASA (P = 0.005) and GDF9 (P = 0.001).
H9 Oct4-EGFP[+] cells developed to ovarian follicle-like structures after culture for 28 days but with low efficiency.
Unlike SCF and BMP4, retinoic acid co-treatment enhanced VASA, GDF9 and SCP3 expression.
A protocol is recommended to enrich differentiated HES cells with germ-cell potential by culture with granulosa cells, conditioned medium or retinoic acid, manual selection of Oct4-EGFP[+] cells, and analysis of VASA, GDF9 expression, or both.'] 

24613594 The ciliary proteins Meckelin and Jouberin are required for retinoic acid-dependent neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['The dysfunction of the primary cilium, a complex, evolutionarily conserved, organelle playing an important role in sensing and transducing cell signals, is the unifying pathogenetic mechanism of a growing number of diseases collectively termed "ciliopathies", typically characterized by multiorgan involvement.
Developmental defects of the central nervous system (CNS) characterize a subset of ciliopathies showing clinical and genetic overlap, such as Joubert syndrome (JS) and Meckel syndrome (MS).
Although several knock-out mice lacking a variety of ciliary proteins have shown the importance of primary cilia in the development of the brain and CNS-derived structures, developmental in vitro studies, extremely useful to unravel the role of primary cilia along the course of neural differentiation, are still missing.
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have been recently proven to mimic brain development, giving the unique opportunity to dissect the CNS differentiation process along its sequential steps.
In the present study we show that mESCs express the ciliary proteins Meckelin and Jouberin in a developmentally-regulated manner, and that these proteins co-localize with acetylated tubulin labeled cilia located at the outer embryonic layer.
Further, mESCs differentiating along the neuronal lineage activate the cilia-dependent sonic hedgehog signaling machinery, which is impaired in Meckelin knock-out cells but results unaffected in Jouberin-deficient mESCs.
However, both lose the ability to acquire a neuronal phenotype.
Altogether, these results demonstrate a pivotal role of Meckelin and Jouberin during embryonic neural specification and indicate mESCs as a suitable tool to investigate the developmental impact of ciliary proteins dysfunction.'] 

25982268 Transplantation of Photoreceptor Precursors Isolated via a Cell Surface Biomarker Panel
From Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Self-Forming Retina.
['Loss of photoreceptors due to retinal degeneration is a major cause of untreatable blindness.
Cell replacement therapy, using pluripotent stem cell-derived photoreceptor cells, may be a feasible future treatment.
Achieving safe and effective cell replacement is critically dependent on the stringent selection and purification of optimal cells for transplantation.
Previously, we demonstrated effective transplantation of post-mitotic photoreceptor precursor cells labelled by fluorescent reporter genes.
As genetically labelled cells are not desirable for therapy, here we developed a surface biomarker cell selection strategy for application to complex pluripotent stem cell differentiation cultures.
We show that a five cell surface biomarker panel CD73(+)CD24(+)CD133(+)CD47(+)CD15(-) facilitates the isolation of photoreceptor precursors from three-dimensional self-forming retina differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells.
Importantly, stem cell-derived cells isolated using the biomarker panel successfully integrate and mature into new rod photoreceptors in the adult mouse retinae after subretinal transplantation.
Conversely, unsorted or negatively selected cells do not give rise to newly integrated rods after transplantation.
The biomarker panel also removes detrimental proliferating cells prior to transplantation.
Notably, we demonstrate how expression of the biomarker panel is conserved in the human retina and propose that a similar selection strategy will facilitate isolation of human transplantation-competent cells for therapeutic application.'] 

24530222 Cross-species stromal signaling programs human embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['The generation of human embryonic stem cell lines in the late 1990s awakened new prospects in the research arena.
The opportunity to define and direct the differentiation of the most primitive stem cells in the laboratory, and their potential application to regenerative medicine, invigorated the developmental biology field.
Whilst initial studies used in vitro differentiation techniques, the application of in vivo models greatly enhanced the success of directing the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.
Controlling cell fate decisions in embryonic cells requires thorough knowledge of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that direct differentiation and the complex cell-cell interactions that exist within different tissues.
Thus, tissue-specific approaches were applied to generate various differentiated cell types.
In this review, cross-species tissue recombination will be discussed as a successful approach to direct embryonic stem cell differentiation.'] 

23852953 Enhanced chondrogenesis through specific growth factors in a buffalo embryonic stem cell model.
['Chondrogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via embryoid bodies (EBs) is an established model to investigate chondrogenesis signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms in vitro.
Our aim has been to improve upon the number of differentiated cells needed for the in vitro development of functional cartilage.
Chondrogenic differentiation of buffalo ESCs was modulated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1 ) individually and their combination.
ESCs differentiation into chondrocytes was characterized by the appearance of Alcian blue-stained nodules and the expression of cartilage-associated genes (RT-PCR) and protein (immunocytochemistry).
BMP-2 or FGF-10 treatment enhanced chondrogenic differentiation, whereas TGF-β1 treatment inhibited buffalo ESC-derived chondrogenesis.
The combination of BMP-2 and FGF-10 was the most effective treatment.
This treatment resulted in a higher number of Alcian blue-positive nodules by 15.2-fold, expression of the mesenchymal cell marker scleraxis gene by 3.25-fold, and the cartilage matrix protein collagen II gene and protein 1.9- and 7-fold, respectively, compared to the untreated control group.
Chondrogenesis was also recapitulated from mesenchymal and chondrogenic progenitor cells, resulting in the establishment of mature chondrocytes.
Thus, buffalo ESCs can be successfully triggered in vitro to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells by specific growth factors, which may provide a novel in vitro model for further investigation of the regulatory mechanism(s) involved.'] 

23852884 Nanoscale topography and chemistry affect embryonic stem cell self-renewal and early differentiation.
['Adherent cells respond to a wide range of substrate cues, including chemistry, topography, hydrophobicity, and surface energy.
The cell-substrate interface is therefore an important design parameter in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications, where substrate cues are used to influence cell behavior.
Thin films comprising 4.5 nm (average diameter) gold nanoparticles coated with a mixture of two alkanethiols can confer hemispherical topography and specific chemistry to bulk substrates.
The behavior of murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) on the thin films can then be compared with their behavior on self-assembled monolayers of the same alkanethiols on vapor-deposited gold, which lack the topographical features.
Cells cultured both with and without differentiation inhibitors are characterized by immunofluorescence for Oct4 and qPCR for Fgf5, Foxa2, Nanog, Pou5f1, and Sox2.
Nanoscale chemistry and topography are found to influence stem cell differentiation, particularly the early differentiation markers, Fgf5 and Foxa2.
Nanoscale topography also affects Oct4 localization, whereas the chemical composition of the substrate does not have an effect.
It is demonstrated for the first time that ESCs can sense topographical features established by 4.5 nm particles, and these findings suggest that nanoscale chemistry and topography can act synergistically to influence stem cell differentiation.
This study furthers the understanding of the effects of these substrate properties, improving our ability to design materials to control stem cell fate.'] 

24375542 Influence of in vitro and in vivo oxygen modulation on β cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.
['The possibility of using human embryonic stem (hES) cell-derived β cells as an alternative to cadaveric islets for the treatment of type 1 diabetes is now widely acknowledged.
However, current differentiation methods consistently fail to generate meaningful numbers of mature, functional β cells.
In order to address this issue, we set out to explore the role of oxygen modulation in the maturation of pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells differentiated from hES cells.
We have previously determined that oxygenation is a powerful driver of murine PP differentiation along the endocrine lineage of the pancreas.
We hypothesized that targeting physiological oxygen partial pressure (pO2) levels seen in mature islets would help the differentiation of PP cells along the β-cell lineage.
This hypothesis was tested both in vivo (by exposing PP-transplanted immunodeficient mice to a daily hyperbaric oxygen regimen) and in vitro (by allowing PP cells to mature in a perfluorocarbon-based culture device designed to carefully adjust pO2 to a desired range).
Our results show that oxygen modulation does indeed contribute to enhanced maturation of PP cells, as evidenced by improved engraftment, segregation of α and β cells, body weight maintenance, and rate of diabetes reversal in vivo, and by elevated expression of pancreatic endocrine makers, β-cell differentiation yield, and insulin production in vitro.
Our studies confirm the importance of oxygen modulation as a key variable to consider in the design of β-cell differentiation protocols and open the door to future strategies for the transplantation of fully mature β cells.'] 

25525250 Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation.
['Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3.
The role of the H3.3K27M mutation in tumorigenesis is not fully understood.
Here, we use a human embryonic stem cell system to model this tumor.
We show that H3.3K27M expression synergizes with p53 loss and PDGFRA activation in neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, resulting in neoplastic transformation.
Genome-wide analyses indicate a resetting of the transformed precursors to a developmentally more primitive stem cell state, with evidence of major modifications of histone marks at several master regulator genes.
Drug screening assays identified a compound targeting the protein menin as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth in vitro and in mice.']

25311359 Influence of substrate composition on human embryonic stem cell differentiation and extracellular matrix production in embryoid bodies.
['Stem cells reside in specialized niches in vivo.
Specific factors, including the extracellular matrix (ECM), in these niches are directly responsible for maintaining the stem cell population.
During development, components of the stem cell microenvironment also control differentiation with precise spatial and temporal organization.
The stem cell microenvironment is dynamically regulated by the cellular component, including stem cells themselves.
Thus, a mechanism exists whereby stem cells modify the ECM, which in turn affects the fate of the stem cell.
In this study, we investigated whether the type of ECM initially adsorbed to the culture substrate can influence the composition of the ECM deposited by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiating in embryoid bodies, and whether different ECM composition and deposition profiles elicit distinct differentiation fates.
We have shown that the initial ECM environment hESCs are exposed to affects the fate decisions of those cells and that this initial ECM environment is constantly modified during the differentiation process.'] 

23041930 Self-renewal of embryonic-stem-cell-derived progenitors by organ-matched mesenchyme.
['One goal of regenerative medicine, to use stem cells to replace cells lost by injury or disease, depends on producing an excess of the relevant cell for study or transplantation.
To this end, the stepwise differentiation of stem cells into specialized derivatives has been successful for some cell types, but a major problem remains the inefficient conversion of cells from one stage of differentiation to the next.
If specialized cells are to be produced in large numbers it will be necessary to expand progenitor cells, without differentiation, at some steps of the process.
Using the pancreatic lineage as a model for embryonic-stem-cell differentiation, we demonstrate that this is a solvable problem.
Co-culture with organ-matched mesenchyme permits proliferation and self-renewal of progenitors, without differentiation, and enables an expansion of more than a million-fold for human endodermal cells with full retention of their developmental potential.
This effect is specific both to the mesenchymal cell and to the progenitor being amplified.
Progenitors that have been serially expanded on mesenchyme give rise to glucose-sensing, insulin-secreting cells when transplanted in vivo.
Theoretically, the identification of stage-specific renewal signals can be incorporated into any scheme for the efficient production of large numbers of differentiated cells from stem cells and may therefore have wide application in regenerative biology.'] 

23426569 Infected periodontal granulation tissue contains cells expressing embryonic stem cell markers.
A pilot study.
['The commonly practiced removal of granulation tissue during periodontal surgery, aiming to eliminate infection and optimize healing conditions, may also remove progenitor stem cells that could otherwise support periodontal regeneration.
The present study aimed to investigate if cells with embryonic stem cell properties are present in periodontal granulation tissue.
During the course of flap surgery inflammatory granulation tissue was obtained from four patients and five periodontal defects.
Tissues were processed in a collagenase/dispase solution to release the cells.
Part of the resulting suspension was processed for bacteriological analysis (IAI PadoTest 4.5), whereas the remaining cell suspension was cultured and passaged once.
Upon reaching confluence, total RNA was extracted, followed by cDNA synthesis.
PCR was then performed (SYBR Green-based protocols) to measure gene expression levels of Collagen type I, and embryonic stem cell markers Nanog, Oct4, Rex-1 and Sox2.
Results are expressed as 2⁻Δ(Ct) values of the target gene, calibrated against a house-keeping gene (GAPDH).
A high total bacterial load up to 20.6 ± 11.0×10(6)

Collagen type I was strongly expressed, confirming the predominance of mesenchymal/fibroblastic cells.
Among the studied embryonic stem cells markers, Nanog was most highly expressed (2.3 ± 1.2), followed by Oct4 (1.1 ± 0.5), Rex-1 (0.6 ± 0.2) and Sox2 (0.3 ± 0.2).
This is the first study that demonstrates the presence of cells expressing embryonic stem cell markers among infected granulation tissue.

26080816 The nucleoporin Nup153 regulates embryonic stem cell pluripotency through gene silencing.
['Nucleoporins (Nups) are a family of proteins best known as the constituent building blocks of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), membrane-embedded channels that mediate nuclear transport across the nuclear envelope.
Recent evidence suggests that several Nups have additional roles in controlling the activation and silencing of developmental genes; however, the mechanistic details of these functions remain poorly understood.
Here, we show that depletion of Nup153 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes the derepression of developmental genes and induction of early differentiation.
This loss of stem cell identity is not associated with defects in the nuclear import of key pluripotency factors.
Rather, Nup153 binds around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of developmental genes and mediates the recruitment of the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to a subset of its target loci.
Our results demonstrate a chromatin-associated role of Nup153 in maintaining stem cell pluripotency by functioning in mammalian epigenetic gene silencing.'] 

24527810 Embryonic stem cell-derived haematopoietic progenitor cells down-regulate the CD3 ξ chain on T cells, abrogating alloreactive T cells.
['Murine embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) engraft and populate lymphoid organs.
In vivo, HPCs engraft across MHC barriers protecting donor-type allografts from rejection.
However, the underlying phenomenon remains elusive.
Here, we sought to determine the mechanism by which ES cell-derived HPCs regulate alloreactive T cells.
We used the 2C mouse, which expresses a transgenic T-cell receptor against H2-L(d) to determine whether HPCs are deleted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
Previously, we reported that HPCs express MHC class I antigens poorly and do not express class II antigens.
In vitro stimulated 2C CTLs failed to lyse H2-L(d)
HPCs in a standard 4-hr (51) chromium release assay.
Similarly, when the HPCs were tested in an ELISPOT assay measuring the release of interferon-γ by CTLs, HPCs failed to induce CTL degranulation.
In addition, mice that were injected with HPCs showed a marked decrease in T-cell responses to alloantigen and CD3 stimulation, but showed a normal response to PMA/ionomycin, suggesting that HPCs impaired T-cell signalling through the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex.
Here, we show that HPCs secrete arginase, an enzyme that scavenges l-arginine, leading to metabolites that down-regulate CD3 ζ chain.
Indeed an arginase inhibitor partially restored expression of the CD3 ζ chain, implicating arginase 1 in the down-regulation of T cells.
This previously unrecognized property of ES cell-derived HPCs could positively enhance the engraftment of ES cell-derived HPCs across MHC barriers by preventing rejection.'] 

24280418 Electrophysiological properties of neurosensory progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells.
['In severe cases of sensorineural hearing loss where the numbers of auditory neurons are significantly depleted, stem cell-derived neurons may provide a potential source of replacement cells.
The success of such a therapy relies upon producing a population of functional neurons from stem cells, to enable precise encoding of sound information to the brainstem.
Using our established differentiation assay to produce sensory neurons from human stem cells, patch-clamp recordings indicated that all neurons examined generated action potentials and displayed both transient sodium and sustained potassium currents.
Stem cell-derived neurons reliably entrained to stimuli up to 20 pulses per second (pps), with 50% entrainment at 50 pps.
A comparison with cultured primary auditory neurons indicated similar firing precision during low-frequency stimuli, but significant differences after 50 pps due to differences in action potential latency and width.
The firing properties of stem cell-derived neurons were also considered relative to time in culture (31-56 days) and revealed no change in resting membrane potential, threshold or firing latency over time.
Thus, while stem cell-derived neurons did not entrain to high frequency stimulation as effectively as mammalian auditory neurons, their electrical phenotype was stable in culture and consistent with that reported for embryonic auditory neurons.'] 

23861021 Rapidly constructed scaffold-free embryonic stem cell sheets for ocular surface reconstruction.
['This study is an extension of our previously published work demonstrating the generation of corneal epithelial sheets using optimal centrifugation procedure.
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for ocular surface reconstruction in rabbits with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) using the centrifugation method.
Rabbits with LSCD were assigned to two groups: 30 LSCD rabbits were treated with scaffold-free embryonic stem cells sheets (SESCS) and six LSCD rabbits received no treatment (control group).
The two groups were followed up for 15 days using slit lamp observation.
Cytokeratin K3, mucin 5AC, and OCT-4 were used to evaluate the re-epithelialization of the cornea.
Fluorescent DiIC18(3)-DS dye was used to trace the transplanted cells.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the cultured epithelial cells of the SESCS-treated group.
The SESCS transplant facilitated the reconstruction of the ocular surface in 75% of the treated animals.
Conjunctivalization and neovascularization were observed in the control group.
The SESCS group was K3 positive and MUC5AC negative, and OCT-4 was observed on the re-epithelialized corneal epithelium.
Labeled SESCS cells were detected in vivo at 15 days post-transplant.
Using AFM, three different types of cultured cells were identified in the rabbit corneal epithelium of the SESCS treatment group.
The SESCS were demonstrated to reconstruct the ocular surface in rabbits with LSCD. ES cells differentiated into corneal epithelial cells when in direct contact with the stroma and thus can serve as a cell source in corneal tissue engineering.'] 

26691605 Chick embryos can form teratomas from microinjected mouse embryonic stem cells.
['We examined whether chick embryos are a suitable experimental model for the evaluation of pluripotency of stem cells.
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) expressing the reporter gene, LacZ or GFP were injected into the subgerminal cavity of blastoderms (freshly oviposited) or the marginal vein of chick embryos (2\xa0days of incubation).
Injected mESCs were efficiently incorporated into the body and extra-embryonic tissues of chick embryos and formed small clusters.
Increased donor cell numbers injected were positively associated with the efficiency of chimera production, but with lower viability.
A single mESC injected into the blastoderm proliferated into 34.7\xa0±\xa03.8 cells in 3\xa0days, implying that the chick embryo provides an optimal environment for the growth of xenogenic cells.
In the embryo body, mESCs were interspersed as small clustered chimeras in various tissues.
Teratomas were observed in the yolk sac and the brain with three germ layers.
In the yolk sac, clusters of mESCs gradually increased in volume and exhibited varied morphology such as a water balloon-like or dark-red solid mass.
However, mESCs in the brain developed into a large soft tissue mass of whitish color and showed a tendency to differentiate into ectodermal lineage cells, including primitive neural ectodermal and neuronal cells expressing the neurofilament protein.
These results indicate that chick embryos are useful for the teratoma formation assays of mESCs and have a broad-range potential as an experimental host model.'] 

21932307 Increased expression of Syne1/nesprin-1 facilitates nuclear envelope structure changes in embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['We found by electron microscopy that the inter-membrane space of embryonic stem cells is irregular and generally wider than in differentiated cells.
Among a panel of nuclear envelope structural proteins examined, the expression of Syne1/nesprin-1 was found to be greatly induced upon differentiation.
Down-regulation of Syne1 by siRNA in differentiated embryonic stem cells caused the nuclear envelope to adopt a configuration resembling that found in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
Suppression of Syne1 expression did not produce a detectable impact on the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells; however, forced expression of Syne1 enhanced the tendency of the cells to lose pluripotency.
Thus, we found that low expression of Syne1 splicing isoforms accounts for the wider and irregular nuclear envelope inter-membrane space in embryonic stem cells.
We conclude that the nuclear envelope structural change accompanying differentiation likely participates in promoting the differential chromatin organization of the differentiated cells.'] 

24705302 Multiparametric High Content Analysis for assessment of neurotoxicity in differentiated neuronal cell lines and human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons.
['The potential for adverse neurotoxic reactions in response to therapeutics and environmental hazards continues to prompt development of novel cell-based assays to determine neurotoxic risk.
A challenge remains to characterize and understand differences between assays and between neuronal cellular models in their responses to neurotoxicants if scientists are to determine the optimal model, or combination of models, for neurotoxicity screening.
Most studies to date have focused on developmental neurotoxicity applications.
This study reports the development of a robust multiparameter High Content Analysis (HCA) assay for neurotoxicity screening in three differentiated neuronal cell models - SH-SY5Y, PC12 and human embryonic stem cell-derived hN2™ cells.
Using a multiplexed detection reagent panel (Hoechst nuclear stain; antibodies against βIII-Tubulin and phosphorylated neurofilament subunit H, and Mitotracker(®)
Red CMXRos), a multiparametric HCA assay was developed and used to characterize a test set of 36 chemicals.
HCA data generated were compared to data generated using MTT and LDH assays under the same assay conditions.
Data showed that multiparametric High Content Analysis of differentiated neuronal cells is feasible, and represents a highly effective method for obtaining large quantities of robust data on the neurotoxic effects of compounds compared with cytotoxicity assays like MTT and LDH.
Significant differences were observed between the responses to compounds across the three cellular models tested, illustrating the heterogeneity in responses to neurotoxicants across different cell types.
This study provides data strongly supporting the use of cellular imaging as a tool for neurotoxicity assessment in differentiated neuronal cells, and provides novel insights into the neurotoxic effects of a test set of compounds upon differentiated neuronal cell lines and human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons.']

25196518 Effects of pulsed electromagnetic field on differentiation of HUES-17 human embryonic stem cell line.

In this study, human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line HUES-17 was applied to explore the mechanism of exposure on embryonic development to pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) for 400 pulses at different electric field intensities and the differentiation of HUES-17 cells was observed after PEMF exposure.
The expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP), stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3), SSEA-4 and the mRNA level and protein level of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in HUES-17 cells remained unchanged after PEMF exposure at the electric field intensities of 50, 100, 200 or 400 kV/m.
Four hundred pulses PEMF exposure at the electric field intensities of 50,
100, 200 or 400 kV/m did not affect the differentiation of HUES-17 cells.
The reason why electromagnetic fields affect embryonic development may be due to other mechanisms rather than affecting the differentiation of embryonic stem cells.']

26455415 MFG-E8 Is Critical for Embryonic Stem Cell-Mediated T Cell Immunomodulation.
['The molecules and mechanisms pertinent to the low immunogenicity of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remain poorly understood.
Here, we provide evidence that milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a vital mediator in this phenomenon and directly suppresses T\xa0cell immune responses.
MFG-E8 is enriched in undifferentiated ESCs but diminished in differentiated ESCs.
Upregulation of MFG-E8 in ESCs increases the successful engraftment of both undifferentiated and differentiated ESCs across major histocompatibility complex barriers.
MFG-E8 suppresses T\xa0cell activation/proliferation and inhibits Th1, Th2, and Th17 subpopulations while increasing regulatory T\xa0cell subsets.
Neutralizing MFG-E8 substantially abrogates these effects, whereas addition of recombinant MFG-E8 to differentiated ESCs restores immunosuppression.
Furthermore, we provide the evidence that MFG-E8 suppresses T\xa0cell activation and regulates T\xa0cell polarization by inhibiting PKCθ phosphorylation through the α3/5βV integrin receptor.
Our findings offer an approach to facilitate transplantation acceptance.'] 

25727014 Oct3/4 directly regulates expression of E2F3a in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, have a characteristic cell cycle with truncated G1 and G2 phases.
Recent findings that suppression of Oct3/4 expression results in a reduced proliferation rate of ES cells suggest the involvement of Oct3/4 in the regulation of ES cell growth, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.
In the present study, we identified E2F3a as a direct target gene of Oct3/4 in ES cells.
Oct3/4 directly bound to the promoter region of the E2F3a gene and positively regulated expression of E2F3a in mouse ES cells.
Suppression of E2F3a activity by E2F6 overexpression led to the reduced proliferation in ES cells, which was relieved by co-expression of E2F3a.
Furthermore, cell growth retardation caused by loss of Oct3/4 was rescued by E2F3a expression.
These results suggest that Oct3/4 upregulates E2F3a expression to promote ES cell growth.']

Recently, there have been considerable advances in the field of embryonic stem cell biology, particularly in the area of pluripotency maintenance in the epiblast from which the mESCs are derived.
Here we describe a protocol for efficient derivation of germline-competent mESCs from any mouse strain, including strains previously deemed nonpermissive.
We provide a protocol that is generally applicable to most inbred strains, as well as a variant for nonpermissive strains.
By using this protocol, mESCs can be derived in 3 weeks and fully characterized after an additional 12 weeks, at efficiencies as high as 90% and in any strain background.'] 

25454634 3D reconstitution of the patterned neural tube from embryonic stem cells.
['Inducing organogenesis in 3D culture is an important aspect of stem cell research.
Anterior neural structures have been produced from large embryonic stem cell (ESC) aggregates, but the steps involved in patterning such complex structures have been ill defined, as embryoid bodies typically contained many cell types.
Here we show that single mouse ESCs directly embedded in Matrigel or defined synthetic matrices under neural induction conditions can clonally form neuroepithelial cysts containing a single lumen in 3D. Untreated cysts were uniformly dorsal and could be ventralized to floor plate (FP).
Retinoic acid posteriorized cysts to cervical levels and induced localize FP formation yielding full patterning along the dorsal/ventral (DV) axis.
Correct spatial organization of motor neurons, interneurons, and dorsal interneurons along the DV axis was observed.
This system serves as a valuable tool for studying morphogen action in 3D and as a source of patterned spinal cord tissue.']

The human embryonic stem cell proteome revealed by multidimensional fractionation followed by tandem mass spectrometry.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have received considerable attention due to their therapeutic potential and usefulness in understanding early development and cell fate commitment.
In order to appreciate the unique properties of these pluripotent, self-renewing cells, we have performed an in-depth multidimensional fractionation followed by LC-MS/MS analysis of the hESCs harvested from defined media to elucidate expressed, phosphorylated, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modified, and secreted proteins.
From the triplicate analysis, we were able to assign more than 3000 proteins with less than 1% false-discovery rate.
This analysis also allowed us to identify nearly 500 phosphorylation sites and 68 sites of O-GlcNAc modification with the same high confidence.
Investigation of the phosphorylation sites allowed us to deduce the set of kinases that are likely active in these cells.
We also identified more than 100 secreted proteins of hESCs that likely play a role in extracellular matrix formation and remodeling, as well as autocrine signaling for self-renewal and maintenance of the undifferentiated state.
Finally, by performing in-depth analysis in triplicate, spectral counts were obtained for these proteins and posttranslationally modified peptides, which will allow us to perform relative quantitative analysis between these cells and any derived cell type in the future.']

26209649 Multiple cell and population-level interactions with mouse embryonic stem cell heterogeneity.
['Much of development and disease concerns the generation of gene expression differences between related cells sharing similar niches.
However, most analyses of gene expression only assess population and time-averaged levels of steady-state transcription.
The mechanisms driving differentiation are buried within snapshots of the average cell, lacking dynamic information and the diverse regulatory history experienced by individual cells.
Here, we use a quantitative imaging platform with large time series data sets to determine the regulation of developmental gene expression by cell cycle, lineage, motility and environment.
We apply this technology to the regulation of the pluripotency gene Nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells.
Our data reveal the diversity of cell and population-level interactions with Nanog dynamics and heterogeneity, and how this regulation responds to triggers of pluripotency.
Cell cycles are highly heterogeneous and cycle time increases with Nanog reporter expression, with longer, more variable cycle times as cells approach ground-state pluripotency.
Nanog reporter expression is highly stable over multiple cell generations, with fluctuations within cycles confined by an attractor state.
Modelling reveals an environmental component to expression stability, in addition to any cell-autonomous behaviour, and we identify interactions of cell density with both cycle behaviour and Nanog.
Rex1 expression dynamics showed shared and distinct regulatory effects.
Overall, our observations of multiple partially overlapping dynamic heterogeneities imply complex cell and environmental regulation of pluripotent cell behaviour, and suggest simple deterministic views of stem cell states are inappropriate.'] 

24768975 Developmental cardiotoxicity effects of four commonly used antiepileptic drugs in embryonic chick heart micromass culture and embryonic stem cell culture systems.
['Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used drugs in pregnant women with epilepsy.
Prenatal exposure to AEDs increases the risk of major or minor congenital malformation during embryonic development.
The precise mode of action and intracellular mechanisms of these AEDs during embryonic development remains unclear.
To determine relative teratogenic risk of AEDs, four AED drugs including valproic acid (VPA), phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), and trimethadione (TMD) were tested using two in vitro systems (the embryonic chick heart micromass (MM) culture and the in vitro differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes culture systems).
Cardiomyocyte cultures (the heart MM and ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes) were treated with or without different concentrations of PHT, PB, TMD (10-100 μM), and VPA (100-2000 μM).
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (1-10 μM) and l-ascorbic acid (10-1000 μM) were used as positive and negative controls.
It was found that these four commonly used AEDs and 5-FU tested have the potential to inhibit embryonic heart cell differentiation (p<0.05) without inducing any cytotoxicity.
VPA at higher concentrations (≥800 μM), and 5-FU at all doses proved to be cytotoxic in the differentiating ES cell culture system.
The results demonstrated in this study suggest that the use of these four commonly prescribed AEDs during pregnancy may have an effect on embryonic heart development, and may be associated with congenital cardiovascular defects.'] 

27484865 Transplantation of Donor-Origin Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Thymic Epithelial Progenitors Prevents the Development of Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Mice.
[StringElement(': Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant diseases.
However, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remains a significant cause of late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSCT. cGVHD often manifests as autoimmune syndrome.
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) play a critical role in supporting negative selection and regulatory T-cell (Treg) generation.
Studies have shown that damage in TECs is sufficient to induce cGVHD. We have previously reported that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be selectively induced to generate thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs) in vitro.
When transplanted in vivo, mESC-TEPs further develop into TECs that support T-cell development.
We show here that transplantation of donor-origin mESC-TEPs into cGVHD recipients induces immune tolerance to both donor and host antigens and prevents the development of cGVHD.
This is associated with more TECs and Tregs.

26676601 Size-Dependent Toxicity of Gold Nanoparticles on Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Their Neural Derivatives.
["This study explores the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for assessing nanotoxicology, specifically, the effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different core sizes (1.5, 4, and 14 nm) on the viability, pluripotency, neuronal differentiation, and DNA methylation of hESCs.
The hESCs exposed to 1.5 nm thiolate-capped AuNPs exhibit loss of cohesiveness and detachment suggesting ongoing cell death at concentrations as low as 0.1 μg mL(-1).
The cells exposed to 1.5 nm AuNPs at this concentration do not form embryoid bodies but rather disintegrate into single cells within 48 h. Cell death caused by 1.5 nm AuNPs also occur in hESC-derived neural progenitor cells.
None of the other nanoparticles exhibit toxic effects on the hESCs at concentrations as high as 10 μg mL(-1) during a 19 d neural differentiation period.
Thiolate-capped 4 nm AuNPs at 10 μg mL(-1) cause a dramatic decrease in global DNA methylation (5 mC) and a corresponding increase in global DNA hydroxymethylation (5 hmC) of the hESC's DNA in only 24 h. This work identifies a type of AuNPs highly toxic to hESCs and demonstrates the potential of hESCs in predicting nanotoxicity and characterizing their ability to alter the DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns in the cells."] 

25263550 Control of embryonic stem cell identity by BRD4-dependent transcriptional elongation of super-enhancer-associated pluripotency genes.
['Transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling complexes are key determinants of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity.
Here, we demonstrate that BRD4, a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of epigenetic readers, regulates the self-renewal ability and pluripotency of ESCs.
BRD4 inhibition resulted in induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and commitment to the neuroectodermal lineage while reducing the ESC multidifferentiation capacity in teratoma assays.
BRD4 maintains transcription of core stem cell genes such as OCT4 and PRDM14 by occupying their super-enhancers (SEs), large clusters of regulatory elements, and recruiting to them Mediator and CDK9, the catalytic subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to allow Pol-II-dependent productive elongation.
Our study describes a mechanism of regulation of ESC identity that could be applied to improve the efficiency of ESC differentiation.'] 

26806855 Autophagy-related gene 5 and Wnt5 signaling pathway requires differentiation of embryonic stem cells into odontoblast-like cells.
['We previously confirmed a unique and unanticipated role for an α2 integrin, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (Emmprin), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3-mediated signaling cascade, in driving the odontoblast-like differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in a collagen type-I scaffold (CS) combined with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 (CS/BMP-4).
To explore the early signaling cascade for odontoblastic differentiation, we examined the upregulation of autophagy-related gene (Atg) and Wnt signaling by CS/BMP-4 mediated odontoblast differentiation.
In a screening experiment, CS/BMP-4 increased the mRNA and protein levels of Atg5, Lrp5/Fzd9 (an Atg5 receptor), and Wnt5, but not microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3; a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8), TFE3, Beclin1, and Atg12, together with the amount of autophagosomes and autophagy fluxes.
Treatment with siRNAs against Atg5 and Wnt5 individually suppressed the CS/BMP-4-induced increase in odontoblast differentiation.
The odontoblastic phenotype, involving dentin matrix protein-1 and dentin sialophosphoprotein expression, decreased when autophagy was inhibited by chloroquine, but increased after treatment with rapamycin (an autophagy enhancer).
Taken together with our previous findings, we have revealed a unique sequential cascade involving Atg5, Wnt5a, α2 integrin, Emmprin, and MMP-3.
This cascade results in a potent increase in odontoblastic cell differentiation, indicating the unique involvement of Atg5, autophagy and Wnt5 signaling in CS/BMP-4-induced differentiation of ES cells into odontoblast-like cells, at a relatively early stage.'] 

22678753 In vivo differentiation potential of buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) embryonic stem cell.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from inner cell mass (ICM) of mammalian blastocyst are having indefinite proliferation and differentiation capability for any type of cell lineages.
In the present study, ICMs of in vitro-derived buffalo blastocysts were cultured into two different culture systems using buffalo fetal fibroblast as somatic cell support and Matrigel as synthetic support to obtain pluripotent buffalo embryonic stem cell (buESC) colonies.
Pluripotency of the ESCs were characterised through pluripotency markers whereas, their differentiation capability was assessed by teratoma assay using immuno-compromised mice.
Cumulus ooccyte complexes from slaughter house-derived ovaries were subjected to in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture to generate blastocysts.
Total 262 blastocysts were derived through IVEP with 11.83 % (31/262) hatching rate.
To generate buESCs, 15 ICMs from hatched blastocysts were cultured on mitomycin-C-treated homologous fetal fibroblast feeder layer, whereas the leftover 16 ICMs were cultured on extra-cellular matrix (Matrigel).
No significant differences were observed for primary ESCs colony formation between two culture systems.
Primary colonies as well as passaged ESCs were characterised by alkaline phosphatase staining, karyotyping and expression of transcription-based stem cell markers, OCT-4 and cell surface antigens SSEA-4 and TRA-1-60.
Batch of ESCs found positive for pluripotency markers and showing normal karyotype after fifteenth passage were inoculated into eight immuno-compromised mice through subcutaneous and intramuscular route.
Subcutaneous route of inoculation was found to be better than intramuscular route.
Developed teratomas were excised surgically and subjected to histological analysis.
Histological findings revealed presence of all the three germinal layer derivatives in teratoma sections.
Presence of germinal layer derivatives were further confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of differentiation markers like nerve cell adhesion molecule, fetal liver kinase-1 and alpha-feto protein for ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, respectively.'] 

23829223 Influence of activin
A supplementation during human embryonic stem cell derivation on germ cell differentiation potential.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are more similar to "primed" mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs).
mEpiSCs, which are derived in Activin A, show an increased propensity to form primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells in response to bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4).
Hence, we hypothesized that hESCs derived in the presence of Activin A may be more competent in differentiating towards PGC-like cells after supplementation with BMP4 compared to standard hESC lines.
We were able to successfully derive two hESC lines in the presence of Activin A, which were pluripotent and showed higher base levels of STELLA and cKIT compared to standard hESC lines derived without Activin
A addition.
Furthermore, upon differentiation as embryoid bodies in the presence of BMP4, we observed upregulation of VASA at day 7, both at the transcript and protein level compared to standard hESC lines, which appeared to take longer time for PGC specification.
Unlike other hESC lines, nuclear pSMAD2/3 presence confirmed that Activin signalling was switched on in Activin A-derived hESC lines.
They were also responsive to BMP4 based on nuclear detection of pSMAD1/5/8 and showed endodermal differentiation as a result of GATA-6 expression.
Hence, our results provide novel insights into the impact of hESC derivation in the presence of Activin A and its subsequent influence on germ cell differentiation potential in vitro.'] 

26797580 Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 promotes neuronal differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
['Rho kinase (ROCK) regulates the functions of several target proteins via its kinase activity.
Therefore, ROCK activity inhibition may provide new possibilities of controlling the in vitro neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells.
When we investigated the effects of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 on ES cell differentiation, we found that this inhibitor promoted the differentiation of these cells into neurons.
Furthermore, we found that ROCK inhibition may promote the neuronal differentiation of ES cells by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) involved in the ERK signaling pathway.
In this study, we investigated the effects of specific inhibitors of several cellular signaling components on the promotion of neuronal differentiation in ES cells to clarify the roles of cellular signaling pathways in the ROCK inhibitor-mediated cell differentiation process.
Our results suggest that ERK may be activated via the Ras/Raf/MEK, the PI3K/PKC, or the Cdc42/Rac signaling pathways in the ROCK inhibitor-mediated promotion of neuronal differentiation in ES cells.']

24480513 A statistical approach towards the derivation of predictive gene sets for potency ranking of chemicals in the mouse embryonic stem cell test.
['The embryonic stem cell test (EST) is applied as a model system for detection of embryotoxicants.
The application of transcriptomics allows a more detailed effect assessment compared to the morphological endpoint.
Genes involved in cell differentiation, modulated by chemical exposures, may be useful as biomarkers of developmental toxicity.
We describe a statistical approach to obtain a predictive gene set for toxicity potency ranking of compounds within one class.
This resulted in a gene set based on differential gene expression across concentration-response series of phthalatic monoesters.
We determined the concentration at which gene expression was changed at least 1.5-fold.
Genes responding with the same potency ranking in vitro and in vivo embryotoxicity were selected.
A leave-one-out cross-validation showed that the relative potency of each phthalate was always predicted correctly.
The classical morphological 50% effect level (ID50) in EST was similar to the predicted concentration using gene set expression responses.
A general down-regulation of development-related genes and up-regulation of cell-cycle related genes was observed, reminiscent of the differentiation inhibition in EST.
This study illustrates the feasibility of applying dedicated gene set selections as biomarkers for developmental toxicity potency ranking on the basis of in vitro testing in the EST.'] 

26239678 Lymphoid lineage differentiation potential of mouse nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells.
['Stem cells therapy is considered as an efficient strategy for the treatment of some diseases.
Nevertheless, some obstacles such as probability of rejection by the immune system limit applications of this strategy.
Therefore, several efforts have been made to overcome this among which using the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and nuclear transfer embryonic stem cell (nt-ESCs) are the most efficient strategies.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the differentiation potential of the nt-ESCs to lymphoid lineage in the presence of IL-7, IL-3, FLT3-ligand and TPO growth factors in\xa0vitro.
To this end, the nt-ESCs cells were prepared and treated with aforementioned growth factors for 7 and 14 days.
Then, the cells were examined for expression of lymphoid markers (CD3, CD25, CD127 and CD19) by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and flow cytometry.
An increased expression of CD19 and CD25 markers was observed in the treated cells compared with the negative control samples by day 7.
After 14 days, the expression level of all the tested CD markers significantly increased in the treated groups in comparison with the control.
The current study reveals the potential of the nt-ESCs in differentiation to lymphoid lineage in the presence of defined growth factors.'] 

23305950 Characterization of calcium signals in human embryonic stem cells and in their differentiated offspring by a stably integrated calcium indicator protein.
['Intracellular calcium signaling pathways play a major role in cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) provide new possibilities to explore the development and differentiation of various cell types of the human body.
Intracellular calcium responses to various ligands and the calcium signaling pathways, however, have not been thoroughly studied in embryonic stem cells and in their differentiated progenies.
In our previous work we demonstrated that the use of the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 with confocal microscopy allows sensitive and reliable measurements of calcium modulation in human embryonic stem cells and stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes.
Here we developed a human embryonic stem cell line stably expressing a genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator (GCaMP2) using a transposon-based gene delivery system.
We found that the differentiation properties were fully preserved in the GCaMP2-expressing hESC lines and Ca imaging could be performed without the need of toxic dye-loading of the cells.
In undifferentiated hES cells the calcium signals induced by various ligands, ATP, LPA, trypsin or angiotensin II were comparable to those in Fluo-4 loaded cells.
In accordance with previous findings, no calcium signal was evoked by thrombin, histamine or GABA. Cardiomyocyte colonies differentiated from hES-GCaMP2 cells could be recognized by spontaneous contractions and Ca(2+) oscillations.
GCaMP2-expressing neural cells were identified based on their morphological and immuno-staining properties and Ca signals were characterized on those cells.
Characteristics of both the spontaneous and ligand-induced Ca(2+) signals, as well as their pharmacological modification could be successfully examined in these model cells by fluorescence imaging.'] 

25258312 DEPTOR is a stemness factor that regulates pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.
['The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates stem cell regeneration and differentiation in response to growth factors, nutrients, cellular energetics, and various extrinsic stressors.
Inhibition of mTOR activity has been shown to enhance the regenerative potential of pluripotent stem cells.
DEPTOR is the only known endogenous inhibitor of all known cellular mTOR functions.
We show that DEPTOR plays a key role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency by limiting mTOR activity in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
DEPTOR levels dramatically decrease with differentiation of mouse ESCs, and knockdown of DEPTOR is sufficient to promote ESC differentiation.
A strong decrease in DEPTOR expression is also observed during human ESCs differentiation.
Furthermore, reduction in DEPTOR level during differentiation is accompanied by a corresponding increase in mTOR complex 1 activity in mouse ESCs.
Our data provide evidence that DEPTOR is a novel stemness factor that promotes pluripotency and self-renewal in ESCs by inhibiting mTOR signaling.'] 

26511924 FGF/MAPK signaling sets the switching threshold of a bistable circuit controlling cell fate decisions in embryonic stem cells.
['Intracellular transcriptional regulators and extracellular signaling pathways together regulate the allocation of cell fates during development, but how their molecular activities are integrated to establish the correct proportions of cells with particular fates is not known.
Here we study this question in the context of the decision between the epiblast (Epi) and the primitive endoderm (PrE) fate that occurs in the mammalian preimplantation embryo.
Using an embryonic stem cell (ESC) model, we discover two successive functions of FGF/MAPK signaling in this decision.
First, the pathway needs to be inhibited to make the PrE-like gene expression program accessible for activation by GATA transcription factors in ESCs.
In a second step, MAPK signaling levels determine the threshold concentration of GATA factors required for PrE-like differentiation, and thereby control the proportion of cells differentiating along this lineage.
Our findings can be explained by a simple mutual repression circuit modulated by FGF/MAPK signaling.
This might be a general network architecture to integrate the activity of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulators, and serve to balance proportions of cell fates in several contexts.']

24200714 Temporal impact of substrate mechanics on differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes.
['A significant clinical need exists to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes, enabling tissue modeling for in vitro discovery of new drugs or cell-based therapies for heart repair in vivo.
Chemical and mechanical microenvironmental factors are known to impact the efficiency of stem cell differentiation, but cardiac differentiation protocols in hPSCs are typically performed on rigid tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surfaces, which do not present a physiological mechanical setting.
To investigate the temporal effects of mechanics on cardiac differentiation, we cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derivatives on polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates with a physiologically relevant range of stiffnesses.
In directed differentiation and embryoid body culture systems, differentiation of hESCs to cardiac troponin T-expressing (cTnT+) cardiomyocytes peaked on hydrogels of intermediate stiffness.
Brachyury expression also peaked on intermediate stiffness hydrogels at day 1 of directed differentiation, suggesting that stiffness impacted the initial differentiation trajectory of hESCs to mesendoderm.
To investigate the impact of substrate mechanics during cardiac specification of mesodermal progenitors, we initiated directed cardiomyocyte differentiation on TCPS and transferred cells to hydrogels at the Nkx2.5/Isl1+ cardiac progenitor cell stage.
No differences in cardiomyocyte purity with stiffness were observed on day 15.
These experiments indicate that differentiation of hESCs is sensitive to substrate mechanics at early stages of mesodermal induction, and proper application of substrate mechanics can increase the propensity of hESCs to differentiate to cardiomyocytes.']

Here, we have initially differentiated hESCs into functional hepatic endoderm (HE) and continued the differentiation by replating them onto galactosylated collagen (GC) and collagen matrices.
The differentiation of hESC-HE cells into HLCs on GC substrate showed significant up-regulation of hepatic-specific genes such as ALB, HNF4α, CYP3A4, G6P, and ASGR1.
There was more albumin secretion and urea synthesis, as well as more cytochrome p450 activity, in differentiated HLCs on GC compared to the collagen-coated substrate.
These results suggested that GC substrate has the potential to be used for in vitro maturation of hESC-HLCs.'] 

25250519 Leptin enhances endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis in murine embryonic stem cells.
['The metabolic regulation of leptin and its angiogenic effects have been well characterized in adult mammals.
However, the role of leptin in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) has not been characterized.
We hypothesized that leptin enhances the generation of ECs derived from ESCs and, in this way, promotes angiogenesis in embryonic vessels.
To address this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro model consisting of murine ESCs-derived embryoid bodies (EBs).
Vascular density, EC and angiogenesis markers as well as phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) were investigated in leptin-treated EBs and in untreated EBs as controls.
ESC-derived ECs were isolated by magnetic sorting based on the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31).
Significant upregulation of EC and angiogenic markers as well as higher vessel density were found in leptin-treated EBs compared to controls.
CD31 positive enriched cells derived from leptin-treated EBs had improved proliferation and survival rate and showed higher levels of pSTAT3.
These results suggested that leptin promotes EC differentiation and angiogenesis in mouse EBs and that janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway can play a role in this biological process.
Leptin-mediated EC differentiation and angiogenesis in ESCs can be a useful application towards regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.'] 

23843329 Patterning pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.
['Developmental gradients of morphogens and the formation of boundaries guide the choices between self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells.
Still, surprisingly little is known about gene expression signatures of differentiating stem cells at the boundaries between regions.
We thus combined inducible gene expression with a microfluidic technology to pattern gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells.
Regional depletion of the Nanog transcriptional regulator was achieved through the exposure of cells to microfluidic gradients of morphogens.
In this way, we established pluripotency-differentiation boundaries between Nanog expressing cells (pluripotency zone) and Nanog suppressed cells (early differentiation zone) within the same cell population, with a gradient of Nanog expression across the individual cell colonies, to serve as a mimic of the developmental process.
Using this system, we identified strong interactions between Nanog and its target genes by constructing a network with Nanog as the root and the measured levels of gene expression in each region.
Gene expression patterns at the pluripotency-differentiation boundaries recreated in vitro were similar to those in the developing blastocyst.
This approach to the study of cellular commitment at the boundaries between gene expression domains, a phenomenon critical for understanding of early development, has potential to benefit fundamental research of stem cells and their application in regenerative medicine.']

They are obtained from supernumerary human in vitro fertilization embryos that cannot be used for infertility treatment.
Following studies on factors regulating pluripotency and differentiation, we now have techniques to establish and effectively expand these cells in animal substance-free conditions, even from single cells biopsied from eight-cell stage embryos in chemically defined feeder-free cultures.
The genetic stability and absence of tumorigenic mutations can be determined.

26059508 Core Pluripotency Factors Directly Regulate Metabolism in Embryonic Stem Cell to Maintain Pluripotency.
['Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have distinct metabolic properties that support their metabolic and energetic needs and affect their stemness.
In particular, high glycolysis is critical for the generation and maintenance of PSCs.
However, it is unknown how PSCs maintain and acquire this metabolic signature.
In this study, we found that core pluripotency factors regulate glycolysis directly by controlling the expression of glycolytic enzymes.
Specifically, Oct4 directly governs Hk2 and Pkm2, which are important glycolytic enzymes that determine the rate of glycolytic flux.
The overexpression of Hk2 and Pkm2 sustains high levels of glycolysis during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation.
Moreover, the maintenance of high glycolysis levels by Hk2 and Pkm2 overexpression hampers differentiation and preserves the pluripotency of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor.
Overall, our study identifies a direct molecular connection between core pluripotency factors and ESC metabolic signatures and demonstrates the significance of metabolism in cell fate determination.'] 

26406898 Embryonic Stem Cell Growth Factors Regulate eIF2α Phosphorylation.
['Growth factors and transcription factors are well known to regulate pluripotent stem cells, but less is known about translational control in stem cells.
Here, we use embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to investigate a connection between ESC growth factors and eIF2α-mediated translational control (eIF2α phosphorylation promotes protein expression from mRNAs with upstream open-reading frames, or uORFs).
We find abundant phosphorylated P-eIF2α (P-eIF2α) in both pluripotent mouse and human ESCs, but little P-eIF2α in ESCs triggered to differentiate.
We show that the growth factors LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and BMP4 (bone morphogenic protein 4) both maintain P-eIF2α in mESCs, but use distinct mechanisms: LIF inhibits an eIF2α phosphatase whereas BMP4 activates an eIF2α kinase.
The mRNAs encoding the pluripotency factors Nanog and c-Myc possess uORFs while Oct4 mRNA does not.
We find that salubrinal, a chemical that increases eIF2α phosphorylation, promotes Nanog and c-Myc expression, but not Oct4 expression.
These experiments connect ESC growth factors to eIF2α phosphorylation and suggest a chemical substitute for LIF to enhance Nanog and c-Myc expression.'] 

25733019 CDK1 inhibition targets the p53-NOXA-MCL1 axis, selectively kills embryonic stem cells, and prevents teratoma formation.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have adopted an accelerated cell-cycle program with shortened gap phases and precocious expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).
We examined the effect of CDK inhibition on the pathways regulating proliferation and survival of ESCs.
We found that inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) leads to activation of the DNA damage response, nuclear p53 stabilization, activation of a subset of p53 target genes including NOXA, and negative regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 in human and mouse ESCs, but not differentiated cells.
We demonstrate that MCL1 is highly expressed in ESCs and loss of MCL1 leads to ESC death.
Finally, we show that clinically relevant CDK1 inhibitors prevent formation of ESC-derived tumors and induce necrosis in established ESC-derived tumors.
Our data demonstrate that ES cells are uniquely sensitive to CDK1 inhibition via a p53/NOXA/MCL1 pathway.'] 

26094604 Epigenetic regulation of embryonic stem cell marker miR302C in human chondrosarcoma as determinant of antiproliferative activity of proline-rich polypeptide 1.
['Metastatic chondrosarcoma of mesenchymal origin is the second most common bone malignancy and does not respond either to chemotherapy or radiation; therefore, the search for new therapies is relevant and urgent.
We described recently that tumor growth inhibiting cytostatic proline-rich polypeptide 1, (PRP-1)
significantly upregulated tumor suppressor miRNAs, downregulated onco-miRNAs in human chondrosarcoma JJ012 cell line, compared to chondrocytes culture.
In this study we hypothesized the existence and regulation of a functional marker in cancer stem cells, correlated to peptides antiproliferative activity.
Experimental results indicated that among significantly downregulated miRNA after PRP-1treatment was miRNAs 302c*.
This miRNA is a part of the cluster miR302‑367, which is stemness regulator in human embryonic stem cells and in certain tumors, but is not expressed in adult hMSCs and normal tissues.
PRP-1 had strong inhibitory effect on viability of chondrosarcoma and multilineage induced multipotent adult cells (embryonic primitive cell type).
Unlike chondrosarcoma, in glioblastoma, PRP-1 does not have any inhibitory activity on cell proliferation, because in glioblastoma miR-302-367 cluster plays an opposite role, its expression is sufficient to suppress the stemness inducing properties.
The observed correlation between the antiproliferative activity of PRP-1 and its action on downregulation of miR302c explains the peptides opposite effects on the upregulation of proliferation of adult mesenchymal stem cells, and the inhibition of the proliferation of human bone giant-cell tumor stromal cells, reported earlier.
PRP-1 substantially downregulated the miR302c targets, the stemness markers Nanog, c-Myc and polycomb protein Bmi-1.
miR302c expression is induced by JMJD2-mediated H3K9me2 demethylase activity in its promoter region.
JMJD2 was reported to be a positive regulator for Nanog.
Our experimental results proved that PRP-1 strongly inhibited H3K9 activity comprised of a pool of JMJD1 and JMJD2.
We conclude that inhibition of H3K9 activity by PRP-1 leads to downregulation of miR302c and its targets, defining the PRP-1 antiproliferative role.'] 

24740926 JMJD5 regulates cell cycle and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells.
['In mammalian embryos, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent cells, a shortened G1 phase is correlated with the pluripotent state.
To molecularly define this phase, we compared transcripts from the shortened G1 of human ESCs (hESCs) with those from the longer G1 of derived endoderm.
We identified JMJD5, a JmjC (Jumonji C) domain containing protein that, when depleted in hESCs, causes the accumulation of cells in G1 phase, loss of pluripotency, and subsequent differentiation into multiple lineages, most prominently ectoderm and trophectoderm.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the JMJD5 phenotype is caused by the upregulation of CDKN1A (p21), as depleting both JMJD5 and CDKN1A (p21) in hESCs restores the rapid G1 phase and rescues the pluripotent state.
Overall, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the JMJD5/CDKN1A (p21) axis is essential to maintaining the short G1 phase which is critical for pluripotency in hESCs.'] 

24740448 Brief report: Parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells are an effective cell source for therapeutic liver repopulation.
['Parthenogenesis is the development of an oocyte without fertilization.
Mammalian parthenogenetic (PG) embryos are not viable, but can develop into blastocysts from which embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been derived in mouse and human.
PG ESCs are frequently homozygous for alleles encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.
MHC homozygosity permits much more efficient immune matching than MHC heterozygosity found in conventional ESCs, making PG ESCs a promising cell source for cell therapies requiring no or little immune suppression.
However, findings of restricted differentiation and proliferation of PG cells in developmental chimeras have cast doubt on the potential of PG ESC derivatives for organ regeneration.
To address this uncertainty, we determined whether PG ESC derivatives are effective in rescuing mice with lethal liver failure due to deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah).
In developmental chimeras generated by injecting wild-type PG ESCs into Fah-deficient blastocysts, PG ESCs differentiated into hepatocytes that could repopulate the liver, provide normal liver function, and facilitate long-term survival of adult mice.
Moreover, after transplantation into adult Fah-deficient mice, PG ESC-derived hepatocytes efficiently engrafted and proliferated, leading to high-level liver repopulation.
Our results show that--despite the absence of a paternal genome--PG ESCs can form therapeutically effective hepatocytes.'] 

24838914 Slice Culture Method for Studying Migration of Neuronal Progenitor Cells Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC).
['In this unit we describe an overlay brain slice culture assay for studying migration of transgenic neurospheres derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC).
Neuronal progenitor cells were generated from hESC by derivation of embryoid bodies and rosettes.
Rosettes were transfected using the PiggyBac transposon system with either control plasmids (GFP) or plasmid encoding a gene important for migration of neuronal progenitor cells, Doublecortin (DCX).
Transfected cells were subsequently grown in low-adhesion plates to generate transgenic human neurospheres (t-hNS).
Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from postnatal rat forebrain and maintained using the interface method, before transfected t-hNS were overlaid below the cortex of each hemisphere.
After 1 to 5 days, forebrain slices were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence.
The distance at which cells migrated from the center of neurospheres to the host forebrain tissue was measured using Image J software.
This protocol provides details for using the slice culture method for studying migration and integration of human neuronal cells into the host brain tissue.'] 

26694615 c-Rel Regulates Inscuteable Gene Expression during Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation.
['Inscuteable (Insc) regulates cell fate decisions in several types of stem cells.
Although it is recognized that the expression levels of mouse INSC govern the balance between symmetric and asymmetric stem cell division, regulation of mouse Insc gene expression remains poorly understood.
Here, we showed that mouse Insc expression transiently increases at an early stage of differentiation, when mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells differentiate into bipotent mesendoderm capable of producing both endoderm and mesoderm in defined culture conditions.
We identified the minimum transcriptional regulatory element (354 bases) that drives mouse Insc transcription in mES cells within a region
>5 kb upstream of the mouse Insc transcription start site.
We found that the transcription factor reticuloendotheliosis oncogene (c-Rel) bound to the minimum element and promoted mouse Insc expression in mES cells.
In addition, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either mouse INSC or c-Rel protein decreased mesodermal cell populations without affecting differentiation into the mesendoderm or endoderm.
Furthermore, overexpression of mouse INSC rescued the mesoderm-reduced phenotype induced by knockdown of c-Rel.
We propose that regulation of mouse Insc expression by c-Rel modulates cell fate decisions during mES cell differentiation.'] 

24519983 Discovery of consensus gene signature and intermodular connectivity defining self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells.
['Molecular markers defining self-renewing pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been identified by relative comparisons between undifferentiated and differentiated cells.
Most of analysis has been done under a specific differentiation condition that may present significantly different molecular changes over others.
Therefore, it is currently unclear if there are true consensus markers defining undifferentiated human ESCs (hESCs).
To identify a set of key genes consistently altered during differentiation of hESCs regardless of differentiation conditions, we have performed microarray analysis on undifferentiated hESCs (H1 and H9) and differentiated EBs and validated our results using publicly available expression array datasets.
We constructed consensus modules by Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis and discovered novel markers that are consistently present in undifferentiated hESCs under various differentiation conditions.
We have validated top markers (downregulated: LCK, KLKB1, and SLC7A3; upregulated: RhoJ, Zeb2, and Adam12) upon differentiation.
Functional validation analysis of LCK in self-renewal of hESCs using LCK inhibitor or gene silencing with siLCK resulted in a loss of undifferentiation characteristics-morphological change, reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and pluripotency gene expression, demonstrating a potential functional role of LCK in self-renewal of hESCs.
We have designated hESC markers to interactive networks in the genome, identifying possible interacting partners and showing how new markers relate to each other.
Furthermore, comparison of these datasets with available datasets from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) revealed that the level of these newly identified markers was correlated to the establishment of iPSCs, which may imply a potential role of these markers in gaining of cellular potency.'] 

24737281 Evaluation of developmental toxicity using undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells.
['An embryonic stem cell test (EST) has been developed to evaluate the embryotoxic potential of chemicals with an in vitro system.
In the present study, novel methods to screen toxic chemicals during the developmental process were evaluated using undifferentiated human embryonic stem (hES) cells.
By using surface marker antigens (SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81), we confirmed undifferentiated conditions of the used hES cells by immunocytochemistry.
We assessed the developmental toxicity of embryotoxic chemicals, 5-fluorouracil, indomethacin and non-embryotoxic penicillin G in different concentrations for up to 7 days.
While expressions of the surface markers were not significantly affected, the embryotoxic chemicals influenced their response to pluripotent ES cell markers, such as OCT-4, NANOG, endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB), secreted frizzled related protein 2 (SFRP2), teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (TDGF1), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).
Most of the pluripotent ES cell markers were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with embryotoxic chemicals.
After treatment with 5-fluorouracil, indomethacin and penicillin G, we observed a remarkable convergence in the degree of up-regulation of development, cell cycle and apoptosis-related genes by gene expression profiles using an Affymetrix GeneChips.
Taken together, these results suggest that embryotoxic chemicals have cytotoxic effects, and modulate the expression of ES cell markers as well as development-, cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes that have pivotal roles in undifferentiated hES cells.
Therefore, we suggest that hES cells may be useful for testing the toxic effects of chemicals that could impact the embryonic developmental stage.'] 

23922292 Reprogramming of two somatic nuclei in the same ooplasm leads to pluripotent embryonic stem cells.
['The conversion of the nuclear program of a somatic cell from a differentiated to an undifferentiated state can be accomplished by transplanting its nucleus to an enucleated oocyte (somatic cell nuclear transfer [SCNT]) in a process termed "reprogramming.
" This process achieves pluripotency and occasionally also totipotency.
Exploiting the obstacle of tetraploidy to full development in mammals, we show that mouse ooplasts transplanted with two somatic nuclei simultaneously (double SCNT) support preimplantation development and derivation of novel tetraploid SCNT embryonic stem cells (tNT-ESCs).
Although the double SCNT embryos do not recapitulate the expression pattern of the pluripotency-associated gene Oct4 in fertilized embryos, derivative tNT-ESCs have characteristics of genuine pluripotency: in vitro they differentiate into neurons, cardiomyocytes, and endodermal cells; in vivo, tNT-ESCs form teratomas, albeit at reduced rates compared to diploid counterparts.
Global transcriptome analysis revealed only few specific alterations, for example, in the quantitative expression of gastrulation-associated genes.
In conclusion, we have shown that the oocyte\'s reprogramming capacity is in excess of a single nucleus and that double nucleus-transplanted embryos and derivative ESCs are very similar to their diploid counterparts.
These results have key implications for reprogramming studies based on pluripotency: while reprogramming in the tetraploid state was known from fusion-mediated reprogramming and from fetal and adult hepatocyte-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we have now accomplished it with enucleated oocytes.']

22731654 Efficient engineering of vascularized ectopic bone from human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
['Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can be derived from various adult and fetal tissues.
However, the quality of tissues for the isolation of adult and fetal hMSCs is donor dependent with a nonreproducible yield.
In addition, tissue engineering and cell therapy require large-scale production of a pure population of lineage-restricted stem cells that can be easily induced to differentiate into a specific cell type.
Therefore, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can provide an alternative, plentiful source for generation of reproducible hMSCs.
We have developed efficient differentiation protocols for derivation of hMSCs from hESCs, including coculture with murine OP9 stromal cells and feeder layer-free system.
Our protocols have resulted in the generation of up to 49% of hMSCs, which expressed CD105, CD90, CD29, and CD44.
The hMSCs exhibited high adipogenic, chondrocytic, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro.
The latter correlated with osteocalcin secretion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the differentiating hMSCs.
hMSC-derived osteoblasts further differentiated and formed ectopic bone in vivo, and induced the formation of blood vessels in Matrigel implants.
Our protocol enables generation of a purified population of hESC-derived MSCs, with the potential of differentiating into several mesodermal lineages, and particularly into vasculogenesis-inducing osteoblasts, which can contribute to the development of bone repair protocols.']

In this study we performed a 4-plex iTRAQ LC-MS/MS based approach, facilitating the multiplexed comparison of the four indicated types of stem cells.

The abundance level of these proteins is not affected by the mode of embryo generation, whereas several cytoskeleton proteins show a higher abundance in NT-mESC compared to FT-mESC.

25119334 Transplantation of neural stem cells clonally derived from embryonic stem cells promotes recovery after murine spinal cord injury.
['The pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI) makes it appropriate for cell-based therapies.
Treatments using neural stem cells (NSCs) in animal models of SCI have shown positive outcomes, although uncertainty remains regarding the optimal cell source.
Pluripotent cell sources such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide a limitless supply of therapeutic cells.
NSCs derived using embryoid bodies (EB) from ESCs have shown tumorigenic potential.
Clonal neurosphere generation is an alternative method to generate safer and more clinically relevant NSCs without the use of an EB stage for use in cell-based therapies.
We generated clonally derived definitive NSCs (dNSCs) from ESC. These cells were transplanted into a mouse thoracic SCI model.
Embryonic stem cell-derived definitive neural stem cell (ES-dNSC)-transplanted mice were compared with controls using behavioral measures and histopathological analysis of tissue.
In addition, the role of remyelination in injury recovery was investigated using transmission electron microscopy.
The SCI group that received ES-dNSC transplantation showed significant improvements in locomotor function compared with controls in open field and gait analysis.
The cell treatment group had a significant enhancement of spared neural tissue.
Immunohistological assessments showed that dNSCs differentiated primarily to oligodendrocytes.
These cells were shown to express myelin basic protein, associate with axons, and support nodal architecture as well as display proper compact, multilayer myelination in electron microscopic analysis.

23197864 Serum- and stromal cell-free hypoxic generation of embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic cells in vitro, capable of multilineage repopulation of immunocompetent mice.
['Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may become a promising source for the generation of patient-specific hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro.
A crucial prerequisite will be the availability of reliable protocols for the directed and efficient differentiation toward HSCs.
So far, the most robust strategy for generating HSCs from pluripotent cells in vitro has been established in the mouse model involving ectopic expression of the human transcription factor HOXB4.
However, most differentiation protocols include coculture on a xenogenic stroma cell line and the use of animal serum.
Involvement of any of both would pose a major barrier to the translation of those protocols to human autologous iPSCs intended for clinical use.
Therefore, we asked whether long-term repopulating HSCs can, in principle, be generated from embryonic stem cells without stroma cells or serum.
Here, we showed that long-term multilineage engraftment could be accomplished in immunocompetent mice when HSCs were generated in serum-free medium without stroma cell support and when hypoxic conditions were used.
Under those conditions, HOXB4(+) embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were immunophenotypically similar to definitive bone marrow resident E-SLAM(+)

Thus, our findings may ease the development of definitive, adult-type HSCs from pluripotent stem cells, entirely in vitro.'] 

21627569 Induction of cardiomyogenesis in human embryonic stem cells by human embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm.
['We previously reported that chick anterolateral endoderm (AL endoderm) induces cardiomyogenesis in mouse embryoid bodies.
However, the requirement to micro-dissect AL endoderm from gastrulation-stage embryos precludes its use to identify novel cardiomyogenic factors, or to scale up cardiomyocyte numbers for therapeutic experiments.
To circumvent this problem we have addressed whether human definitive endoderm (hDE) cells, which can be efficiently generated in large numbers from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), can mimic the ability of AL endoderm to induce cardiac myogenesis.
Results demonstrate that both hDE cells and medium conditioned by them induce cardiac myogenesis in pluripotent hESCs, as indicated by rhythmic beating and immunohistochemical/quantitative polymerase chain reaction monitoring of marker gene expression.
The cardiomyogenic effect of hDE is enhanced when pluripotent hESCs are preinduced to the mes-endoderm state.
Because this approach is tractable and scalable, it may facilitate identification of novel hDE-secreted factors for inclusion in defined cardiomyogenic cocktails.']

In the present study, 90%-pure human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons were incubated with recombinant cell-free pOka-derived virus made with an improved method or VZV vaccine.
We found that cell-free pOka and vOka at higher multiplicities of infection elicited productive infection in neurons followed by spread of infection, cytopathic effect and release of infectious virus into the medium.
These results further validate the use of this unlimited source of human neurons for studying unexplored aspects of VZV interaction with neurons such as entry, latency and reactivation.'] 

26015544 Brachyury and SMAD signalling collaboratively orchestrate distinct mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks in differentiating human embryonic stem cells.
['The transcription factor brachyury (T, BRA) is one of the first markers of gastrulation and lineage specification in vertebrates.
Despite its wide use and importance in stem cell and developmental biology, its functional genomic targets in human cells are largely unknown.
Here, we use differentiating human embryonic stem cells to study the role of BRA in activin A-induced endoderm and BMP4-induced mesoderm progenitors.
We show that BRA has distinct genome-wide binding landscapes in these two cell populations, and that BRA interacts and collaborates with SMAD1 or SMAD2/3 signalling to regulate the expression of its target genes in a cell-specific manner.
Importantly, by manipulating the levels of BRA in cells exposed to different signalling environments, we demonstrate that BRA is essential for mesoderm but not for endoderm formation.
Together, our data illuminate the function of BRA in the context of human embryonic development and show that the regulatory role of BRA is context dependent.
Our study reinforces the importance of analysing the functions of a transcription factor in different cellular and signalling environments.'] 

26840068 Retinoic Acid Specifically Enhances Embryonic Stem Cell Metastate Marked by Zscan4.
['Pluripotency confers Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) the ability to differentiate in ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm derivatives, producing the majority of cell types.
Although the majority of ESCs divide without losing pluripotency, it has become evident that ESCs culture consists of multiple cell populations with different degrees of potency that are spontaneously induced in regular ESC culture conditions.
Zscan4, a key pluripotency factor, marks ESC subpopulation that is referred to as high-level of pluripotency metastate.
Here, we report that in ESC cultures treated with retinoic acid (RA), Zscan4 ESCs metastate is strongly enhanced.
In particular, we found that induction of Zscan4 metastate is mediated via RA receptors (RAR-alpha, RAR-beta, and RAR-gamma), and it is dependent on phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling.
Remarkably, Zscan4 metastate induced by RA lacks canonical pluripotency genes Oct3/4 and Nanog but retained both self-renewal and pluripotency capabilities.
Finally we demonstrated that the conditional ablation of Zscan4 subpopulation is dispensable for both endoderm and mesoderm but is required for ectoderm lineage.
In conclusion, our research provides new insights about the role of RA signaling during ESCs high pluripotency metastate fluctuation.'] 

22906706 Differential responses to retinoic acid and endocrine disruptor compounds of subpopulations within human embryonic stem cell lines.
['The heterogeneous nature of stem cells is an important issue in both research and therapeutic use in terms of directing cell lineage differentiation pathways, as well as self-renewal properties.
Using flow cytometry we have identified two distinct subpopulations by size, large and small, within cultures of human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines.
These two cell populations respond differentially to retinoic acid (RA) differentiation and several endocrine disruptor compounds (EDC).
The large cell population responds to retinoic acid differentiation with greater than a 50% reduction in cell number and loss of Oct-4 expression, whereas the number of the small cell population does not change and Oct-4 protein expression is maintained.
In addition, four estrogenic compounds altered SSEA-3 expression differentially between the two cell subpopulations changing their ratios relative to each other.
Both populations express stem cell markers Oct-4, Nanog, Tra-1-60, Tra-1-80 and SSEA-4, but express low levels of differentiation markers common to the three germ layers.
Cloning studies indicate that both populations can revive the parental population.
Furthermore, whole genome microarray identified approximately 400 genes with significantly different expression between the two populations (p<0.01).
We propose the differential response to RA in these populations is due to differential gene expression of Notch signaling members, CoupTF1 and CoupTF2, chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes that render the small population resistant to RA differentiation.
The findings that hES cells exist as heterogeneous populations with distinct responses to differentiation signals and environmental stimuli will be relevant for their use for drug discovery and disease therapy.']

In this study, we elucidated the mechanistic role of insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and 2) and IGF receptors (IGFR1 and 2) in endothelial differentiation using an embryonic stem cell embryoid body model.
Both IGF1 or IGF2 predisposed embryonic stem to differentiate towards a mesodermal lineage, the endothelial precursor germ layer, as well as increased the generation of significantly more endothelial cells at later stages.
Inhibition of IGFR1 signaling using neutralizing antibody or a pharmacological inhibitor, picropodophyllin, significantly reduced IGF-induced mesoderm and endothelial precursor cell formation.
We confirmed that IGF-IGFR1 signaling stabilizes HIF1α and leads to up-regulation of VEGF during vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies.
Understanding the mechanisms that are critical for vasculogenesis in various models will bring us one step closer to enabling cell based therapies for neovascularization.'] 

25931018 Optimization of adhesive conditions for neural differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells using hydrogels functionalized with continuous Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val concentration gradients.
['Stem cell therapies, which aim to restore neurological function after central nervous system injury, have shown increased efficacy when a tissue engineering matrix is implanted with cells compared to implantation of the cells alone.
However, much work still needs to be done to characterize materials that can be used to facilitate and direct the differentiation of implanted cells.
In the current study, polyethylene glycol hydrogels functionalized with continuous Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)
concentration gradients were fabricated and utilized to systematically study and optimize the adhesive conditions for neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in two- and three-dimensional environments.
The results suggest that 570 μM and 60 μM are the optimal IKVAV concentrations for 2D and 3D neural differentiation, respectively, to maximize mRNA expression of neuron-specific markers and neurite extension while minimizing apoptotic activities in cultured cells compared to those exposed to higher IKVAV concentrations.
The combinatorial approach presented in this work demonstrates that hydrogels functionalized with bioactive peptides provide a defined and tunable platform that can be employed to characterize and improve culture conditions for superior survival, maturation and integration of implanted cells, leading to enhanced restoration of neurological function for those receiving stem cell therapies after traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries.']

26259779 Uniaxial cyclic stretch stimulates TRPV4 to induce realignment of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
['Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in culture are randomly organized and do not typically show directional alignment.
In the present study, we used uniaxial cyclic stretch to facilitate the alignment of cultured human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs), so that these cells can be more adult-like for potential future application in drug screening and in vitro studies of cardiac function.
We then explored the functional role of mechanosensitive TRPV4 channels in cyclic stretch-induced realignment of hESC-CMs.
RT-PCR, immunoblots and immunostaining detected TRPV4 expression in these cells.
4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), a TRPV4 agonist, elicited a cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) rise, the effect of which was abolished by TRPV4 inhibitors RN1734 and HC067047, and a TRPV4 dominant negative construct.
These results confirmed the functional presence of TRPV4 in these cells.
Importantly, longitudinal stretch was found to induce a [Ca(2+)]i rise, the effect of which was inhibited by TRPV4 antagonists.
Furthermore, uniaxial cyclic stretch for 2h induced realignment of hESC-CMs in the direction transverse to the direction of stretch, the effect of which was also abolished by TRPV4 antagonists.
Akt phosphorylation was found to be a downstream signal of TRPV4.
Taken together, these data strongly suggest endogenous TRPV4 channels as a mechanosensor, mediating cyclic stretch-induced realignment of hESC-CMs.']

25002337 Tensile forces applied on a cell-embedded three-dimensional scaffold can direct early differentiation of embryonic stem cells toward the mesoderm germ layer.
['Mechanical forces play an important role in the initial stages of embryo development; yet, the influence of forces, particularly of tensile forces, on embryonic stem cell differentiation is still unknown.
The effects of tensile forces on mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation within a three-dimensional (3D) environment were examined using an advanced bioreactor system.
Uniaxial static or dynamic stretch was applied on cell-embedded collagen constructs.
Six-day-long cyclic stretching of the seeded constructs led to a fourfold increase in Brachyury (BRACH-T) expression, associated with the primitive streak phase in gastrulation, confirmed also by immunofluorescence staining.
Further examination of gene expression characteristic of mESC differentiation and pluripotency, under the same conditions, revealed changes mostly related to mesodermal processes.
Additionally, downregulation of genes related to pluripotency and stemness was observed.
Cyclic stretching of the 3D constructs resulted in actin fiber alignment parallel to the stretching direction.
BRACH-T expression decreased under cyclic stretching with addition of myosin II inhibitor.
No significant changes in gene expression were observed when mESCs were first differentiated in the form of embryoid bodies and then exposed to cyclic stretching, suggesting that forces primarily influence nondifferentiated cells.
Understanding the effects of forces on stem cell differentiation provides a means of controlling their differentiation for later use in regenerative medicine applications and sheds light on their involvement in embryogenesis.'] 

25811991 Human Parthenogenetic Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Neural Stem Cells Express HLA-G and Show Unique Resistance to NK Cell-Mediated Killing.
['Parent-of-origin imprints have been implicated in the regulation of neural differentiation and brain development.
Previously we have shown that, despite the lack of a paternal genome, human parthenogenetic (PG) embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can form proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) that are capable of differentiation into physiologically functional neurons while maintaining allele-specific expression of imprinted genes.
Since biparental ("normal") hESC-derived NSCs (N NSCs) are targeted by immune cells, we characterized the immunogenicity of PG NSCs.
Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry revealed that both N NSCs and PG NSCs exhibited surface expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I but not HLA-DR molecules.
Functional analyses using an in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction assay resulted in less proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with PG compared with N NSCs.
In addition, natural killer (NK) cells cytolyzed PG less than N NSCs.
At a molecular level, expression analyses of immune regulatory factors revealed higher HLA-G levels in PG compared with N NSCs.
In line with this finding, MIR152, which represses HLA-G expression, is less transcribed in PG compared with N cells.
Blockage of HLA-G receptors ILT2 and KIR2DL4 on natural killer cell leukemia (NKL) cells increased cytolysis of PG NSCs.
Together this indicates that PG NSCs have unique immunological properties due to elevated HLA-G expression.']

25610470 Contribution of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells to Chimeras through Injection and Coculture of Embryos.
['Blastocyst injection and morula aggregation are commonly used to evaluate stem cell pluripotency based on chimeric contribution of the stem cells.
To assess the protocols for generating chimeras from stem cells, 8-cell mouse embryos were either injected or cocultured with mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, respectively.
Although a significantly higher chimera rate resulted from blastocyst injection, the highest germline contribution resulted from injection of 8-cell embryos with embryonic stem cells.
The fully agouti colored chimeras were generated from both injection and coculture of 8-cell embryos with embryonic stem cells.
Additionally, microsatellite DNA screening showed that the fully agouti colored chimeras were fully embryonic stem cell derived mice.
Unlike embryonic stem cells, the mouse chimeras were only generated from injection of 8-cell embryos with induced pluripotent stem cells and none of these showed germline transmission.

25999518 Study of Bone Marrow and Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treatment of Escherichia coli Endotoxin-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Mice.
[StringElement(': Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be derived from multiple tissue sources.
However, the optimal source of MSCs for cell-based therapy for acute lung injury (ALI) is unclear.
In the present experiments, we studied bone marrow (BM)-derived and embryonic stem cell-derived human MSC (ES-MSCs) as a therapeutic agent in Escherichia coli endotoxin-induced ALI in mice.
We hypothesized that ES-MSCs would be more potent than BM-MSCs owing to its more primitive source of origin.
ALI was induced by the intratracheal instillation of endotoxin at 4 mg/kg into 10-12-week-old C57BL/6 mice with or without BM-MSCs, ES-MSCs, or normal human lung fibroblasts as a cellular control.
Compared with the endotoxin-injured mice at 48 hours, the administration of ES-MSCs provided results similar to those of BM-MSCs, significantly reducing the influx of white blood cells and neutrophils and decreasing the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the injured alveolus.
BM-MSCs also reduced extravascular lung water, a measure of pulmonary edema, by 60% and the total protein levels, a measure of lung permeability, by 66%.
However, surprisingly, ES-MSCs did not have these protective effects, which was partially explained by the increased secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 9 by ES-MSCs, an enzyme known to increase lung protein permeability.
In conclusion, both BM-MSCs and ES-MSCs markedly decreased endotoxin-induced inflammation.
However, ES-MSCs did not show any beneficial effect on reducing pulmonary edema and lung protein permeability compared with BM-MSCs, suggesting that not all MSCs behave in a similar fashion.
Our results highlight the need perhaps for a disease-specific potency assay for MSCs.', attributes={'Label': 'UNLABELLED'}), StringElement('To determine the optimal source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cell-based therapy for acute lung injury, bone marrow (BM)- and embryonic stem cell-derived human MSC (ES-MSCs) were compared as therapeutic agents for Escherichia coli endotoxin-induced lung injury in mice.

However, unlike BM-MSCs, ES-MSCs provided no protective effects against increasing lung water and protein permeability, in part because of an increase in expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 by ES-MSCs.
In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, impaired alveolar fluid clearance (i.e., no resolution of pulmonary edema fluid) has been associated with higher mortality rates.

25377420 Acute loss of Cited2 impairs Nanog expression and decreases self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Identifying novel players of the pluripotency gene regulatory network centered on Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog as well as delineating the interactions within the complex network is key to understanding self-renewal and early cell fate commitment of embryonic stem cells (ESC).
While overexpression of the transcriptional regulator Cited2 sustains ESC pluripotency, its role in ESC functions remains unclear.
Here, we show that Cited2 is important for proliferation, survival, and self-renewal of mouse ESC. We position Cited2 within the pluripotency gene regulatory network by defining Nanog, Tbx3, and Klf4 as its direct targets.
We also demonstrate that the defects caused by Cited2 depletion are, at least in part, rescued by Nanog constitutive expression.
Finally, we demonstrate that Cited2 is required for and enhances reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.'] 

25929821 Exogenous nitric oxide enhances calcification in embryonic stem cell-derived osteogenic cultures.
['While the involvement of nitric oxide in bone formation, homeostasis and healing has been extensively characterized, its role in directing pluripotent stem cells to the osteogenic lineage has not been described.
Yet, the identification of chemical inducers that improve differentiation output to a particular lineage is highly valuable to the development of such cells for the cell-based treatment of osteo-degenerative diseases.
This study aimed at investigating the instructive role of nitric oxide (NO) and its synthesizing enzymes on embryonic stem cell (ESC) osteogenic differentiation.
Our findings showed that NO levels may support osteogenesis, but that the effect of nitric oxide on osteoblast differentiation may be specific to a particular time phase during the development of osteoblasts in vitro.
Endogenously, nitric oxide was specifically secreted by osteogenic cultures during the calcification period.
Simultaneously, messenger RNAs for both the endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase isoforms (eNOS and iNOS) were upregulated during this late phase development.
However, the specific eNOS inhibitor L-N(5)-(1-Iminoethyl)ornithine dihydrochloride attenuated calcification more so than the specific iNOS inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium.
Exogenous stage-specific supplementation of culture medium with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine increased the percentage of cells differentiating into osteoblasts and enhanced calcification.
Our results point to a primary role for eNOS as a pro-osteogenic trigger in ESC differentiation and expand on the variety of supplements that may be used to direct ESC fate to the osteogenic lineage, which will be important in the development of cell-based therapies for osteo-degenerative diseases.'] 

25751085 Islet Endothelial Cells Derived From Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.
['The islet endothelium comprises a specialized population of islet endothelial cells (IECs) expressing unique markers such as nephrin and α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that are not found in endothelial cells in surrounding tissues.
However, due to difficulties in isolating and maintaining a pure population of these cells, the information on these islet-specific cells is currently very limited.
Interestingly, we have identified a large subpopulation of endothelial cells exhibiting IEC phenotype, while deriving insulin-producing cells from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
These cells were identified by the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and were successfully isolated and subsequently expanded in endothelial cell culture medium.
Further analysis demonstrated that the mouse embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (mESC-ECs) not only express classical endothelial markers, such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1), thrombomodulin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) but also IEC-specific markers such as nephrin and AAT.
Moreover, mESC-ECs secrete basement membrane proteins such as collagen type IV, laminin, and fibronectin in culture and form tubular networks on a layer of Matrigel, demonstrating angiogenic activity.
Further, mESC-ECs not only express eNOS, but also its eNOS expression is glucose dependent, which is another characteristic phenotype of IECs.
With the ability to obtain highly purified IECs derived from pluripotent stem cells, it is possible to closely examine the function of these cells and their interaction with pancreatic β-cells during development and maturation in vitro.
Further characterization of tissue-specific endothelial cell properties may enhance our ability to formulate new therapeutic angiogenic approaches for diabetes.'] 

25915124 The histone deacetylase SIRT6 controls embryonic stem cell fate via TET-mediated production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.
['How embryonic stem cells (ESCs) commit to specific cell lineages and yield all cell types of a fully formed organism remains a major question.
ESC differentiation is accompanied by large-scale histone and DNA modifications, but the relations between these epigenetic categories are not understood.
Here we demonstrate the interplay between the histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and the ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs).
SIRT6 targets acetylated histone H3 at Lys 9 and 56 (H3K9ac and H3K56ac), while TETs convert 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
.
ESCs derived from Sirt6 knockout (S6KO) mice are skewed towards neuroectoderm development.
This phenotype involves derepression of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, which causes an upregulation of TET-dependent production of 5hmC. Genome-wide analysis revealed neural genes marked with 5hmC in S6KO ESCs, thereby implicating TET enzymes in the neuroectoderm-skewed differentiation phenotype.
We demonstrate that SIRT6 functions as a chromatin regulator safeguarding the balance between pluripotency and differentiation through Tet-mediated production of 5hmC.'] 

26977925 Immunological Properties of Corneal Epithelial-Like Cells Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
['Transplantation of ex vivo expanded corneal limbal stem cells (LSCs) has been the main treatment for limbal stem cell deficiency, although the shortage of donor corneal tissues remains a major concern for its wide application.
Due to the development of tissue engineering, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-derived corneal epithelial-like cells (ESC-CECs) become a new direction for this issue.
However, the immunogenicity of ESC-CECs is a critical matter to be solved.
In the present study, we explored the immunological properties of ESC-CECs, which were differentiated from ESCs.
The results showed that ESC-CECs had a similar character and function with LSCs both in vitro and in vivo.
In ESC-CECs, a large number of genes related with immune response were down-regulated.
The expressions of MHC-I, MHC-II, and co-stimulatory molecules were low, but the expression of HLA-G was high.
The ESC-CECs were less responsible for T cell proliferation and NK cell lysis in vitro, and there was less immune cell infiltration after transplantation in vivo compared with LSCs.
Moreover, the immunological properties were not affected by interferon-γ. All these results indicated a low immunogenicity of ESC-CECs, and they can be promising in clinical use.'] 

23939048 Neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells as an in vitro tool for the study of the expression patterns of the neuronal cytoskeleton during neurogenesis.
['The neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is a potential tool for elucidating the key mechanisms involved in human neurogenesis.
Nestin and β-III-tubulin, which are cytoskeleton proteins, are marker proteins of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons, respectively.
However, the expression patterns of nestin and β-III-tubulin in neural derivatives from human ESCs remain unclear.
In this study, we found that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from H9 cells express high levels of nestin and musashi-1.
In contrast, β-III-tubulin was weakly expressed in a few NPCs.
Moreover, in these cells, nestin formed filament networks, whereas β-III-tubulin was distributed randomly as small particles.
As the differentiation proceeded, the nestin filament networks and the β-III-tubulin particles were found in both the cell soma and the cellular processes.
Moreover, the colocalization of nestin and β-III-tubulin was found mainly in the cell processes and neurite-like structures and not in the cell soma.
These results may aid our understanding of the expression patterns of nestin and β-III-tubulin during the neural differentiation of H9 cells.'] 

23846691 Inhibition of protein kinase C signaling maintains rat embryonic stem cell pluripotency.
['Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is orchestrated by distinct signaling pathways that are often targeted to maintain ESC self-renewal or their differentiation to other lineages.
We showed earlier that inhibition of PKC signaling maintains pluripotency in mouse ESCs.
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the importance of protein kinase C signaling in the context of rat ESC (rESC) pluripotency.
Here we show that inhibition of PKC signaling is an efficient strategy to establish and maintain pluripotent rESCs and to facilitate reprogramming of rat embryonic fibroblasts to rat induced pluripotent stem cells.
The complete developmental potential of rESCs was confirmed with viable chimeras and germ line transmission.
Our molecular analyses indicated that inhibition of a PKCζ-NF-κB-microRNA-21/microRNA-29 regulatory axis contributes to the maintenance of rESC self-renewal.
In addition, PKC inhibition maintains ESC-specific epigenetic modifications at the chromatin domains of pluripotency genes and, thereby, maintains their expression.
Our results indicate a conserved function of PKC signaling in balancing self-renewal versus differentiation of both mouse and rat ESCs and indicate that targeting PKC signaling might be an efficient strategy to establish ESCs from other mammalian species.'] 

26015546 In vitro myelin formation using embryonic stem cells.
['Myelination in the central nervous system is the process by which oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths around the axons of neurons.
Myelination enables neurons to transmit information more quickly and more efficiently and allows for more complex brain functions; yet, remarkably, the underlying mechanism by which myelination occurs is still not fully understood.
A reliable in vitro assay is essential to dissect oligodendrocyte and myelin biology.
Hence, we developed a protocol to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells and established a myelin formation assay with embryonic stem cell-derived neurons in microfluidic devices.
Myelin formation was quantified using a custom semi-automated method that is suitable for larger scale analysis.
Finally, early myelination was followed in real time over several days and the results have led us to propose a new model for myelin formation.'] 

23404501 Structural complexity of non-acid glycosphingolipids in human embryonic stem cells grown under feeder-free conditions.
['Due to their pluripotency and growth capability, there are great expectations for human embryonic stem cells, both as a resource for functional studies of early human development and as a renewable source of cells for use in regenerative medicine and transplantation.
However, to bring human embryonic stem cells into clinical applications, their cell surface antigen expression and its chemical structural complexity have to be defined.
In the present study, total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were isolated from two human embryonic stem cell lines (SA121 and SA181) originating from leftover in vitro fertilized human embryos, using large amounts of starting material (1 × 10(9) cells/cell line).
The total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were characterized by antibody and lectin binding, mass spectrometry, and proton NMR.
In addition to the globo-series and type 1 core chain glycosphingolipids previously described in human embryonic stem cells, a number of type 2 core chain glycosphingolipids (neo-lactotetraosylceramide, the H type 2 pentaosylceramide, the Le(x) pentaosylceramide, and the Le(y) hexaosylceramide) were identified as well as the blood group A type 1 hexaosylceramide.
Finally, the mono-, di-, and triglycosylceramides were characterized as galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, galabiaosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, and lactotriaosylceramide.
Thus, the glycan diversity of human embryonic stem cells, including cell surface immune determinants, is more complex than previously appreciated.'] 

24637373 Expansion of embryonic stem cells in suspension and fibrous bed bioreactors.
['Applications of embryonic stem (ES) cells in cellular transplantation and tissue engineering require scalable processes for mass production of these cells with controlled qualities.
The main objective of this work was to evaluate two cell culture processes for long-term expansion of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells.
With serial passaging, suspension cultures in spinner flasks were able to expand mES cells as aggregates for 12.5-fold in each passage of 4 days.
However, extending the culturing time to 6 days in each passage caused significant loss in cell viability and induced differentiation as indicated by the reduced expression levels of SSEA-1 and Oct-4.
Long-term expansion of mES cells in a fibrous bed bioreactor (FBB) was also studied for 30 days in 2 passages, 15 days in each passage.
With periodically refreshing the culture medium, a high expansion fold of 60-77 was achieved in each passage.
Flow cytometry and RT-PCR were used to analyze key pluripotency and differentiation markers.
The results showed that the expanded cells in both suspension and FBB cultures remained in a highly pluripotent state, which was also confirmed with the embryoid body (EB) forming efficiency test.
It is concluded that both the suspension and FBB cultures are suitable to support long-term expansion of undifferentiated mES cells.
However, the FBB culture can sustain cell growth for a longer period without frequent passaging, requires less media and labor, and is thus more economical to use for mass production of ES cells.'] 

25074806 p120-catenin regulates REST and CoREST, and modulates mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Although the canonical Wnt pathway and β-catenin have been extensively studied, less is known about the role of p120-catenin (also known as δ1-catenin) in the nuclear compartment.
Here, we report that p120-catenin binds and negatively regulates REST and CoREST (also known as Rcor1), a repressive transcriptional complex that has diverse developmental and pathological roles.
Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), mammalian cell lines, Xenopus embryos and in vitro systems, we find that p120-catenin directly binds the REST-CoREST complex, displacing it from established gene targets to permit their transcriptional activation.
Importantly, p120-catenin levels further modulate the mRNA and protein levels of Oct4 (also known as POU5F1), Nanog and Sox2, and have an impact upon the differentiation of mESCs towards neural fates.
In assessing potential upstream inputs to this new p120-catenin-REST-CoREST pathway, REST gene targets were found to respond to the level of E-cadherin, with evidence suggesting that p120-catenin transduces signals between E-cadherin and the nucleus.
In summary, we provide the first evidence for a direct upstream modulator and/or pathway regulating REST-CoREST, and reveal a substantial role for p120-catenin in the modulation of stem cell differentiation.']

Predicting distinct organization of transcription factor binding sites on the promoter regions: a new genome-based approach to expand human embryonic stem cell regulatory network.
['Self-proliferation and differentiation into distinct cell types have been made stem cell as a promising target for regenerative medicine.
Several key genes can regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
They work together and build a transcriptional hierarchy.
Coexpression and coregulation of genes control by common regulatory elements on the promoter regions.
Consequently, distinct organization and combination of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs modules) on promoter regions, in view of order and distance, lead to a common specific expression pattern within a set of genes.
To gain insights into transcriptional regulation of hESCs, we selected promoter regions of eleven common expressed hESC genes including SOX2, LIN28, STAT3, NANOG, LEFTB, TDGF1, POU5F1, FOXD3, TERF1, REX1 and GDF3 to predict activating regulatory modules on promoters and discover key corresponding transcription factors.
Then, promoter regions in human genome were explored for modules and 328 genes containing the same modules were detected.
Using microarray data, we verified that 102 of 328 genes commonly upregulate in hESCs.
Also, using output data of DNA-protein interaction assays, we found that 42 of all predicted genes are targets of SOX2, NANOG and POU5F1.
Additionally, a protein interaction network of hESC genes was constructed based on biological processes, and interestingly, 126 downregulated genes along with upregulated ones identified by promoter analysis were predicted in the network.
Based on the results, we suggest that the identified genes, coregulating with common hESC genes, represent a novel approach for gene discovery based on whole genome promoter analysis irrespective of gene expression.
Altogether, promoter profiling can be used to expand hESC transcriptional regulatory circuitry by analysis of shared functional sequences between genes.
This approach provides a clear image on underlying regulatory mechanism of gene expression profile and offers a novel approach in designing gene networks of stem cell.'] 

26255987 Influence of oriented nanofibrous PCL scaffolds on quantitative gene expression during neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in combination with three-dimensional electrospun nanofibers as an artificial extracellular matrix can be utilized to reconstruct a spinal cord defect.
In this study, random and parallel-aligned nanofibrous poly ɛ-caprolactone was fabricated using electrospinning.
Its hydrophobicity was modified by O2 plasma treatment to facilitate enhanced cell attachment.
Embryoid bodies (EBs), which contain all three embryonic germ layers, were cultured on poly ɛ-caprolactone scaffolds to study the effect of fiber orientation on cell morphology and differentiation.
Cell morphology and neuron-specific gene and protein expressions were, respectively, evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemistry.
Although two types of nanofibrous scaffolds showed neural marker expression at the protein level, cells on randomly oriented scaffolds showed short-range topographical guidance and stretched across multiple directions, whereas cells on the parallel scaffolds exhibited long extension with enhanced neuron outgrowth along the fiber, producing oriented extracellular matrix, leading to direct cell migration and nerve regeneration.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that both aligned and random electrospun nanofibers downregulated the precursor neural marker Nestin compared with that in the control group, a gelatin-coated tissue culture plate (T).
Analysis also showed higher expression of dorso-ventral neural markers (Isl1/2 and Lim1/2) than motor neuron progenitor markers (Pax6, Nkx6.1, and olig2) in aligned nanofibers than in the T group.
Moreover, aligned nanofibers showed higher expression of mature neural specific markers such as β-tub and Map2 than those in the randomly oriented scaffolds.
Therefore, we conclude that nanofibers with different orientations can support the neural lineage, but aligned nanofibrous scaffolds are superior candidates to promote the advancement of neural precursors to achieve maturity during the differentiation process.']

23351095 Derivation and isolation of NKX2.1-positive basal forebrain progenitors from human embryonic stem cells.
['Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing interneurons are the major inhibitory cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
These interneurons originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and lateral ganglionic eminence of the ventral forebrain during embryonic development and show reduced survival and function in a variety of neurological disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy.
We and others have proposed that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived ventral forebrain progenitors might provide a source of new GABAergic interneurons for cell-based therapies.
While human ESCs (hESCs) are readily differentiated in vitro into dorsal telencephalic neural progenitors, standard protocols for generating ventral subtypes of telencephalic progenitors are less effective.
We now report efficient derivation of GABAergic progenitors using an established hESC reporter line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of an endogenous NKX2.1 promoter.
GABAergic progenitors were derived from this hESC line by a modified monolayer neural differentiation protocol.
Consistent with sonic hedgehog (SHH)-dependent specification of NKX2.1-positive progenitors in the embryonic MGE, we show a dose-dependent increase in the generation of NKX2.1:GFP-positive progenitors after SHH treatment in vitro.
Characterization of NKX2.1:GFP-positive cells confirms their identity as MGE-like neural progenitors, based on gene expression profiles and their ability to differentiate into GABAergic interneurons.
We are also able to generate highly enriched populations of NKX2.1:GFP-positive progenitors, including cells with telencephalic identity, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
These hESC-derived ventral forebrain progenitors are suitable candidates for cell-based therapies that aim at replacing dysfunctional or damaged cortical or hippocampal GABAergic interneurons.'] 

25519956 Functional screen reveals essential roles of miR-27a/24 in differentiation of embryonic stem cells.
['MicroRNAs play important roles in controlling the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state.
Although much is known about microRNAs maintaining ESC state, microRNAs that are responsible for promoting ESC differentiation are less reported.
Here, by screening 40 microRNAs pre-selected by their expression patterns and predicted targets in Dgcr8-null ESCs, we identify 14 novel differentiation-associated microRNAs.
Among them, miR-27a and miR-24, restrained by c-Myc in ESC, exert their roles of silencing self-renewal through directly targeting several important pluripotency-associated factors, such as Oct4, Foxo1 and Smads.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of all miR-27/24 in ESCs leads to serious deficiency in ESC differentiation in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, depleting of them in mouse embryonic fibroblasts can evidently promote somatic cell reprogramming.
Altogether, our findings uncover the essential role of miR-27 and miR-24 in ESC differentiation and also demonstrate novel microRNAs responsible for ESC differentiation.']

26274828 Tropism and Induction of Cytokines in Human Embryonic-Stem Cells-Derived Neural Progenitors upon Inoculation with Highly- Pathogenic Avian H5N1 Influenza Virus.
['Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction caused by neurovirulent influenza viruses is a dreaded complication of infection, and may play a role in some neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson-like diseases and encephalitis lethargica.
Although CNS infection by highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been demonstrated, it is unknown whether H5N1 infects neural progenitor cells, nor whether such infection plays a role in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
To pursue this question, we infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells in vitro with H5N1 virus, and studied the resulting cytopathology, cytokine expression, and genes involved in the differentiation.
Human embryonic stem cells (BG01) were maintained and differentiated into the neural progenitors, and then infected by H5N1 virus (A/Chicken/Thailand/CUK2/04) at a multiplicity of infection of 1.
At 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection (hpi), cytopathic effects were observed.
Then cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, supernatants quantified for virus titers, and sampled cells studied for candidate genes.
The hNPCs were susceptible to H5N1 virus infection as determined by morphological observation and immunofluorescence.
The infection was characterized by a significant up-regulation of TNF-α gene expression, while expressions of IFN-α2, IFN-β1, IFN-γ and IL-6 remained unchanged compared to mock-infected controls.
Moreover, H5N1 infection did not appear to alter expression of neuronal and astrocytic markers of hNPCs, such as β-III tubulin and GFAP, respectively.
The results indicate that hNPCs support H5N1 virus infection and may play a role in the neuroinflammation during acute viral encephalitis.']

23821546 MicroRNA-323-3p regulates the activity of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) via targeting the mRNA of embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) gene in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) mediates epigenetic gene silencing by catalyzing the triple methylation of histone H3 Lys-27 (H3K27me3) to establish a repressive epigenetic state.
PRC2 is involved in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes and is especially essential for embryonic stem cells.
However, how the formation and function of PRC2 are regulated is largely unknown.
Here, we show that a microRNA encoded by the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region of mouse chromosome 12, miR-323-3p, targets Eed (embryonic ectoderm development) mRNA, which encodes one of the core components of PRC2, the EED protein.
Binding of miR-323-3p to Eed mRNA resulted in reduced EED protein abundance and cellular H3K27me3 levels, indicating decreased PRC2 activity.
Such regulation seems to be conserved among mammals, at least between mice and humans.
We demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells with varied developmental abilities had different miR-323-3p as well as EED and H3K27me3 levels, indicating that miR-323-3p may be involved in the regulation of stem cell pluripotency through affecting PRC2 activity.
Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells had much higher miR-323-3p expression and nearly undetectable H3K27me3 levels.
These findings identify miR-323-3p as a new regulator for PRC2 and provide a new approach for regulating PRC2 activity via microRNAs.']

PDGFRα(-) and Flk-1(+)
PDGFRα(+) hematopoietic mesodermal cells from murine embryonic stem cells.
['Lateral mesoderm-derived hemogenic endothelial cells are known to originate the definitive hematopoietic lineage in mouse embryogenesis.
The developmental process of the definitive hematopoietic lineage can be recapitulated by inducing differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in a co-culture system with OP9 stromal cells.
However, the signaling molecules that can modulate the development of the definitive hematopoietic lineage in the OP9 co-culture system have yet to be identified.
Here we report that activin A enhanced the hematopoietic potential of endothelial cells derived from ES cells in the OP9 co-culture system.

23792212 Mouse embryonic stem cells irradiated with γ-rays differentiate into cardiomyocytes but with altered contractile properties.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for their derivation from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst represent a valuable in vitro model to investigate the effects of ionizing radiation on early embryonic cellular response.
Following irradiation, both human and mouse ESCs (mESCs) maintain their pluripotent status and the capacity to differentiate into embryoid bodies and to form teratomas.
Although informative of the maintenance of a pluripotent status, these studies never investigated the capability of irradiated ESCs to form specific differentiated phenotypes.
Here, for the first time, 5Gy-irradiated mESCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, thus allowing the analysis of the long-term effects of ionizing radiations on the differentiation potential of a pluripotent stem cell population.
On treated mESCs, 96h after irradiation, a genome-wide expression analysis was first performed in order to determine whether the treatment influenced gene expression of the surviving mESCs.
Microarrays analysis showed that only 186 genes were differentially expressed in treated mESCs compared to control cells; a quarter of these genes were involved in cellular differentiation, with three main gene networks emerging, including cardiogenesis.
Based on these results, we differentiated irradiated mESCs into cardiomyocytes.
On day 5, 8 and 12 of differentiation, treated cells showed a significant alteration (qRT-PCR) of the expression of marker genes (Gata-4, Nkx-2.5, Tnnc1 and Alpk3) when compared to control cells.
At day 15 of differentiation, although the organization of sarcomeric α-actinin and troponin T proteins appeared similar in cardiomyocytes differentiated from either mock or treated cells, the video evaluation of the kinematics and dynamics of the beating cardiac syncytium evidenced altered contractile properties of cardiomyocytes derived from irradiated mESCs.
This alteration correlated with significant reduction of Connexin 43 foci.
Our results indicate that mESCs populations that survive an ionizing irradiation treatment are capable to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but they have altered contractile properties.'] 

23952622 Developmental-like bone regeneration by human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal cells.
['The in vivo osteogenesis potential of mesenchymal-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-MCs) was evaluated in vivo by implantation on collagen/hydroxyapatite scaffolds into calvarial defects in immunodeficient mice.
This study is novel because no osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation protocols were applied to the cells prior to implantation.
After 6 weeks, X-ray, microCT, and histological analysis showed that the hESC-MCs had consistently formed a highly vascularized new bone that bridged the bone defect and seamlessly integrated with host bone.
The implanted hESC-MCs differentiated in situ to functional hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes forming new bone tissue via an endochondral ossification pathway.
Evidence for the direct participation of the human cells in bone morphogenesis was verified by two separate assays: with Alu and by human mitochondrial antigen positive staining in conjunction with co-localized expression of human bone sialoprotein in histologically verified regions of new bone.
The large volume of new bone in a calvarial defect and the direct participation of the hESC-MCs far exceeds that of previous studies and that of the control adult hMSCs.
This study represents a key step forward for bone tissue engineering because of the large volume, vascularity, and reproducibility of new bone formation and the discovery that it is advantageous to not over-commit these progenitor cells to a particular lineage prior to implantation.
The hESC-MCs were able to recapitulate the mesenchymal developmental pathway and were able to repair the bone defect semi-autonomously without preimplantation differentiation to osteo- or chondroprogenitors.']

24101719 A synthetic nanofibrillar matrix promotes in vitro hepatic differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.
['Embryonic stem (ES) cells recapitulate normal developmental processes and serve as an attractive source for routine access to a large number of cells for research and therapies.
We previously reported that ES cells cultured on M15 cells, or a synthesized basement membrane (sBM) substratum, efficiently differentiated into an endodermal fate and subsequently adopted fates of various digestive organs, such as the pancreas and liver.
Here, we established a novel hepatic differentiation procedure using the synthetic nanofiber (sNF) as a cell culture scaffold.
We first compared endoderm induction and hepatic differentiation between murine ES cells grown on sNF and several other substrata.
The functional assays for hepatocytes reveal that the ES cells grown on sNF were directed into hepatic differentiation.
To clarify the mechanisms for the promotion of ES cell differentiation in the sNF system, we focused on the function of Rac1, which is a Rho family member protein known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
We observed the activation of Rac1 in undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells cultured on sNF plates, but not in those cultured on normal plastic plates.
We also show that inhibition of Rac1 blocked the potentiating effects of sNF on endoderm and hepatic differentiation throughout the whole differentiation stages.
Taken together, our results suggest that morphological changes result in cellular differentiation controlled by Rac1 activation, and that motility is not only the consequence, but is also able to trigger differentiation.
In conclusion, we believe that sNF is a promising material that might contribute to tissue engineering and drug delivery.']

['The cardiac Purkinje fiber network is composed of highly specialized cardiomyocytes responsible for the synchronous excitation and contraction of the ventricles.

Nonetheless, owing to the difficulty in isolating and studying this rare population of cells, the precise role of PC in arrhythmogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for their proarrhythmic behavior are not fully characterized.
Conceptually, a stem cell-based model system might facilitate studies of PC-dependent arrhythmia mechanisms and serve as a platform to test novel therapeutics.
Here, we describe the generation of murine embryonic stem cells (ESC) harboring pan-cardiomyocyte and PC-specific reporter genes.
We demonstrate that the dual reporter gene strategy may be used to identify and isolate the rare ESC-derived PC (ESC-PC) from a mixed population of cardiogenic cells.
ESC-PC display transcriptional signatures and functional properties, including action potentials, intracellular calcium cycling, and chronotropic behavior comparable to endogenous PC.

['Thymopentin is a group of biologically active peptide secreted mainly by the epithelial cells of thymic cortex and medulla.
Whether it promotes T cells production from human embryonic stem cells(hESCs) in vitro remains an elusive issue.
In the present study, we develop a novel strategy that enhances T-cell lineage differentiation of hESCs in collagen matrix culture by sequential cytokine cocktails treatment combined with thymopentin stimulation.
We observed that approximately 30.75% cells expressed CD34 on day 14 of the cultures and expressed the surface markers of erythroid, lymphoid and myeloid lineages.
The results of colony assays and gene expressions by RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) derived from hESCs were capable of multi-lineage differentiation.
Further study revealed that culturing with thymopentin treatment, the CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+) cells sorted from HPCs expressed T-cell-related genes, IKAROS, DNTT, TCRγ and TCRβ, and T-cell surface markers, CD3, cytoplasmic CD3, CD5, CD27, TCRγδ, CD4 and CD8.
The differentiated cells produced the cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in response to stimulation, providing the evidence for T-cell function of these cells.
In conclusion, thymopentin enhances T-cell lineage differentiation from hESCs in vitro by mimicking thymus peptide environment in vivo.'] 

24861201 Germ-cell culture conditions facilitate the production of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['The derivation of embryonic stem-cell (ESC) lines from blastocysts is a very inefficient process.
Murine ESCs are thought to arise from epiblast cells that are already predisposed to a primordial-germ-cell fate.
During the process of ESC derivation from B6D2 F1 hybrid mice, if we first culture the embryo from the two-cell stage in medium supplemented with LIF, we improve the quality of the blastocyst.
When the blastocyst is then cultured in a germ-line stem-cell culture medium (GSCm), we are able to more efficiently (28.3%) obtain quality ESC lines that have a normal karyotype, proper degree of chimerism, and exhibit germ-line transmission when microinjected into blastocysts.
Although germ-cell-specific genes were expressed in all culture medium conditions, GSCm did not shift the transcriptome towards germ-cell specification.
A correlation was further observed between ESC derivation efficiency and the expression of some imprinted genes and retrotransposable elements.
In conclusion, the combination of LIF supplementation followed by culture in GSCm establishes a higher efficiency method for ESC derivation.']

We have previously shown that p63, a member of the p53 family of nuclear proteins, is expressed in proliferative cytotrophoblast (CTB), precursors to terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) in chorionic villi and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) at the implantation site.
Here, we show that BMP4-treated hESCs differentiate into bona fide CTB by direct comparison with primary human placental tissues and isolated CTB through gene expression profiling.
We show that, in primary CTB, p63 levels are reduced as cells differentiate into STB, and that forced expression of p63 maintains cyclin B1 and inhibits STB differentiation.
We also establish that, similar to in vivo events, hESC differentiation into trophoblast is characterized by a p63(+)/KRT7(+)
CTB stem cell state, followed by formation of functional KLF4(+)
STB and HLA-G(+)
EVT.
Finally, we illustrate that downregulation of p63 by shRNA inhibits differentiation of hESCs into functional trophoblast.
Taken together, our results establish that BMP4-treated hESCs are an excellent model of human trophoblast differentiation, closely mimicking the in vivo progression from p63(+)
CTB stem cells to terminally differentiated trophoblast subtypes.'] 

24560741 Hypocapnia leads to enhanced expression of pluripotency and meso-endodermal differentiation genes in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['The efficient utilization of embryonic stem cells for applications like cell based therapy, transplantation and drug discovery largely depends upon the culturing conditions of these cells.
In this report, we have analyzed gene, protein expression and morphological changes of embryonic stem cells when subjected to lowered CO2 levels i.e. hypocapnia.
We studied the quantitative expression of pluripotent genes, Oct3/4, Nanog and Sox2 and genes involved in the differentiation to the three lineages, under varying CO2 levels.
Enhanced expression of these genes was seen at cultures maintained at 1.5% CO2 as compared to those maintained at 5% CO2.
The cells exposed to hypocapnic conditions when subjected to immunocytochemical analysis stained positive for Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox2 transcription factors.
Flow cytometry and western blot further showed that the pluripotent proteins in the 1.5% CO2 maintained cultures have higher levels of expression as compared to the ES cells at 5% CO2.
In addition, there was enhanced differentiation particularly towards the mesodermal and endodermal lineages at cultures maintained and differentiated at 1.5% CO2 at all the time periods analyzed i.e. day 10 (5+5d), 12 (5+7d) and day 15 (5+10d).
These results, which we feel are the first of their kind, indicate that lowered CO2 levels seem to be preferred for the maintenance of pluripotency and the subsequent differentiation.'] 

26026883 Maximizing Clonal Embryonic Stem Cell Derivation by ERK Pathway Inhibition.
['Since the development of inhibitor-based defined culture conditions (known as "2i"), multiple clonal embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines can be readily derived from single cells isolated directly from mouse embryos.
In addition to providing an efficient means to generate ES cells from compound transgenic or murine disease models on any genetic background, this technology can be used to investigate the process of ESC derivation at both a functional and molecular level.
Here, we provide details of the procedure for both maximizing the number of cells in the donor tissue and subsequent effective derivation of multiple clonal ES cell lines.'] 

25553348 Pluripotency properties of embryonic stem cells isolated from stage X blastoderm of Mazandaran native chicken.
["The aim of this study was to isolate Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) from native chicken and to characterize their pluripotency properties through the cellular and molecular markers.
Samples obtained from fertilized eggs from Mazandaran native hens.
Cells were isolated from area of pellucida from stage X native hens' blastoderm.
Then the cells were cultured on inactivated mouse SNL feeder cells in the presence of LIF, IGF-1, bFGF, CNTF, OSM, SCF, Il-6, and Il-11 growth factors.
The native chickens' ESCs colonies were picked up and subsequently passaged.
To characterize the cells, they were analyzed for their alkaline phosphatase activity, and also for the expression of SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60 as embryonic-specific markers at the protein level.
Furthermore, the expression of pluripotency (cPouV, Sox2, and Nanog) and cell lineage specific (Cvh, Brachyury, and Gata6) gene markers was evaluated at the level of mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR. Isolated cells were passaged repeatedly and successfully up to ten passages.
The stemness of embryonic cells has been approved by the activity of the alkaline phosphatase, presence of the SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60 protein, and expression of the molecular marker (cPouV, Nanog, and Sox-2) genes.
The spontaneous differentiation of chicken ESCs confirmed the pluripotecy of the cells in differentiation into specialized cell lineages.
Our observation showed that ESCs can be isolated successfully from stage X blastoderm of Mazandaran native chickens and these cells maintain their stemness properties during multi-passages in vitro."] 

26571212 The metabolome regulates the epigenetic landscape during naive-to-primed human embryonic stem cell transition.
['For nearly a century developmental biologists have recognized that cells from embryos can differ in their potential to differentiate into distinct cell types.
Recently, it has been recognized that embryonic stem cells derived from both mice and humans exhibit two stable yet epigenetically distinct states of pluripotency: naive and primed.
We now show that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and the metabolic state regulate pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
\xa0Specifically, in naive hESCs, NNMT and its enzymatic product 1-methylnicotinamide are highly upregulated, and NNMT is required for low S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels and the H3K27me3 repressive state.
NNMT consumes SAM in naive cells, making it unavailable for histone methylation that represses Wnt and activates the HIF pathway in primed hESCs.
These data support the hypothesis that the metabolome regulates the epigenetic landscape of the earliest steps in human development.'] 

24895273 Nrf2, a regulator of the proteasome, controls self-renewal and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells.
['Nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcription factor for cellular defense against endogenous and exogenous stresses by regulating expression of many antioxidant and detoxification genes.
Here, we show that Nrf2 acts as a key pluripotency gene and a regulator of proteasome activity in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
Nrf2 expression is highly enriched in hESCs and dramatically decreases upon differentiation.
Nrf2 inhibition impairs both the self-renewal ability of hESCs and re-establishment of pluripotency during cellular reprogramming.
Nrf2 activation can delay differentiation.
During early hESC differentiation, Nrf2 closely colocalizes with OCT4 and NANOG.
As an underlying mechanism, our data show that Nrf2 regulates proteasome activity in hESCs partially through proteasome maturation protein (POMP), a proteasome chaperone, which in turn controls the proliferation of self-renewing hESCs, three germ layer differentiation and cellular reprogramming.
Even modest proteasome inhibition skews the balance of early differentiation toward mesendoderm at the expense of an ectodermal fate by decreasing the protein level of cyclin D1 and delaying the degradation of OCT4 and NANOG proteins.
Taken together, our findings suggest a new potential link between environmental stress and stemness with Nrf2 and the proteasome coordinately positioned as key mediators.'] 

25080381 Neuregulin-1 increases connexin-40 and connexin-45 expression in embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
['Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a vital factor involved in heart development.
NRG-1 up-regulated connexin-40 (Cx40) in mice
fetal cardiomyocytes has been reported, while the effect of NRG-1 on expression of connexins in embryonic stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (ESCMs) is limited studied.
The process of cardiomyocytes differentiated from embryonic stem cells with or without NRG-1 treatment was observed continuously.
Exposure to NRG-1 increased the expression of Cx40 and connexin-45 (Cx45) in ESCMs, while the expression of connexin-43 was unchanged regardless of NRG-1 treatment Western blot analysis also confirmed that the expression of Cx40 and Cx45 in the beating foci was increased in the presence of NRG-1.
These results indicate that connexins are differentially regulated by exogenous NRG-1 during cardiomyocytic differentiation of embryonic stem cells.'] 

23715552 Specification of chondrocytes and cartilage tissues from embryonic stem cells.
['Osteoarthritis primarily affects the articular cartilage of synovial joints.
Cell and/or cartilage replacement is a promising therapy, provided there is access to appropriate tissue and sufficient numbers of articular chondrocytes.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent a potentially unlimited source of chondrocytes and tissues as they can generate a broad spectrum of cell types under appropriate conditions in vitro.
Here, we demonstrate that mouse ESC-derived chondrogenic mesoderm arises from a Flk-1(-)/Pdgfrα(+) (F(-)P(+)) population that emerges in a defined temporal pattern following the development of an early cardiogenic F(-)P(+) population.
Specification of the late-arising F(-)P(+) population with BMP4 generated a highly enriched population of chondrocytes expressing genes associated with growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes.
By contrast, specification with Gdf5, together with inhibition of hedgehog and BMP signaling pathways, generated a population of non-hypertrophic chondrocytes that displayed properties of articular chondrocytes.
The two chondrocyte populations retained their hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic properties when induced to generate spatially organized proteoglycan-rich cartilage-like tissue in vitro.
Transplantation of either type of chondrocyte, or tissue generated from them, into immunodeficient recipients resulted in the development of cartilage tissue and bone within an 8-week period.
Significant ossification was not observed when the tissue was transplanted into osteoblast-depleted mice or into diffusion chambers that prevent vascularization.
Thus, through stage-specific manipulation of appropriate signaling pathways it is possible to efficiently and reproducibly derive hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic chondrocyte populations from mouse ESCs that are able to generate distinct cartilage-like tissue in vitro and maintain a cartilage tissue phenotype within an avascular and/or osteoblast-free niche in vivo.'] 

25892252 Isoflurane Inhibits Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Neural Differentiation Through miR-9/E-cadherin Signaling.
['The commonly used inhalation anesthetic, isoflurane, can permeate rapidly through the placental barrier and thus cause toxicity to the central nervous system of the developing fetus.
In this study, we treated pregnant mice with clinically relevant concentration of isoflurane early on in development (days 3.5-6.5), and then found that the fetus growth was inhibited by isoflurane.
We further used the mouse embryonic stem cell (mES cell) to be the early development model to investigate the mechanism of the embryotoxicity of isoflurane and found that isoflurane inhibited self-renewal of mES cells.
In addition, neuronal differentiation from the mES cells treated with isoflurane was also inhibited.
Overexpression of E-cadherin attenuated the effects of isoflurane on self-renewal and the subsequent neuronal differentiation.
We also found that miR-9 can be upregulated by isoflurane.
Overexpression of miR-9 inhibited the self-renewal and subsequent neuronal differentiation.
E-cadherin was directly targeted by miR-9.
Overexpression of E-cadherin can abolish the function of miR-9 or isoflurane on self-renewal and subsequent neuronal differentiation.
These data suggested that isoflurane inhibits self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of mES cells, possibly by regulating the miR-9-E-cadherin signaling.
The result of the current study may provide a novel idea for preventing the toxicity of inhalation anesthetics in the developing fetal brain in clinical practice when pregnant women accept nonobstetric surgery under inhalation general anesthesia.'] 

26723917 The stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor modulates differentiation status and inhibits the proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Hypoxic conditions are suggested to affect the differentiation status of stem cells (SC), including embryonic stem cells (ESC).
Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is one of the main intracellular molecules responsible for the cellular response to hypoxia.
Hypoxia stabilizes HIF by inhibiting the activity of HIF prolyl-hydroxylases (PHD), which are responsible for targeting HIF-alpha subunits for proteosomal degradation.
To address the impact of HIF stabilization on the maintenance of the stemness signature of mouse ESC (mESC), we tested the influence of the inhibition of PHDs and hypoxia (1% O2 and 5% O2) on spontaneous ESC differentiation triggered by leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal for 24 and 48\xa0h.
The widely used panhydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) and PHD inhibitor JNJ-42041935 (JNJ) with suggested higher specificity towards PHDs were employed.
Both inhibitors and both levels of hypoxia significantly increased HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and HIF transcriptional activity in spontaneously differentiating mESC.
This was accompanied by significant downregulation of cell proliferation manifested by the complete inhibition of DNA synthesis and partial arrest in the S phase after 48\xa0h.
Further, HIF stabilization enhanced downregulation of the expressions of some pluripotency markers (OCT-4, NANOG, ZFP-42, TNAP) in spontaneously differentiating mESC.
However, at the same time, there was also a significant decrease in the expression of some genes selected as markers of cell differentiation (e.g. SOX1, BRACH T, ELF5).
In conclusion, the short term stabilization of HIF mediated by the PHD inhibitors JNJ and DMOG and hypoxia did not prevent the spontaneous loss of pluripotency markers in mESC.
However, it significantly downregulated the proliferation of these cells.'] 

26840224 Derivation of Human Skin Fibroblast Lines for Feeder Cells of Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
['After the first derivations of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines on fetal mouse feeder cell layers, the idea of using human cells instead of mouse cells as feeder cells soon arose.
Mouse cells bear a risk of microbial contamination, and nonhuman immunogenic proteins are absorbed from the feeders to hESCs.
Human skin fibroblasts can be effectively used as feeder cells for hESCs.
The same primary cell line, which can be safely used for up to 15 passages after stock preparations, can be expanded and used for large numbers of hESC derivations and cultures.
These cells are relatively easy to handle and maintain.
No animal facilities or animal work is needed.
Here, we describe the derivation, culture, and cryopreservation procedures for research-grade human skin fibroblast lines.
We also describe how to make feeder layers for hESCs using these fibroblasts.'] 

25615417 Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for identification of correctly targeted murine embryonic stem cell clones.
['Following locus-specific genome editing of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the identification of correctly targeted clones remains a challenge.
We applied multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for homologous recombination-based genomic integration of a knockout construct in which part of a gene is deleted.
All candidate ESCs thereby identified were subsequently validated by conventional methods.
Thus, MLPA represents a highly reliable as well as cost- and time-efficient alternative to currently applied methods such as Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches.
It is also applicable to knockin recombination strategies and compatible with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and other genome editing strategies.'] 

26093180 Morphological observation of embryoid bodies completes the in vitro evaluation of nanomaterial embryotoxicity in the embryonic stem cell test (EST).
['The wide and frequent use of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) raises serious concerns about their safety for human health.
Our aim is to evaluate the embryotoxic potential of silver, uncoated and coated zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and silica NMs through the embryonic stem cell test (EST).
EST is a validated in vitro assay that permits classification of chemicals into three classes (non, weakly or strongly embryotoxic).
Because of the peculiar physico-chemical characteristics of NMs, we first adapted and simplified the differentiation protocol.
To verify the efficiency of this adapted protocol we screened 3 well-characterized chemicals (5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea and saccharin).
Next, we assessed the embryotoxic potential of NMs.
Our data showed that silver NM is classified as a strong embryotoxic compound, while coated and uncoated zinc oxide, titanium and silica NMs as weak embryotoxic compounds.
In addition, we observed daily the formation and growth of embryoid bodies (EBs).
We showed that multiple EBs formed in each well starting from 50 μg/ml of SiO2 while EB formation was inhibited starting from 20 μg/ml of ZnO NMs.
This has never been reported with chemicals and could pose a risk of wrongly evaluating the NMs embryotoxic potential.
For NMs, morphological observation of EBs can provide valuable information on early differentiation effects.
Finally, we suggest that the prediction model should be revised for the assessment of NMs embryotoxicity.'] 

26687948 The modeling of Alzheimer's disease by the overexpression of mutant Presenilin 1 in human embryonic stem cells.
["Cellular disease models are useful tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research.
Pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are promising materials for creating cellular models of such diseases.
In the present study, we established cellular models of AD in hESCs that overexpressed the mutant Presenilin 1 (PS1) gene with the use of a site-specific gene integration system.
The overexpression of PS1 did not affect the undifferentiated status or the neural differentiation ability of the hESCs.
We found increases in the ratios of amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42)/Aβ40 and Aβ43/Aβ40.
Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction was observed in a cellular model of AD that overexpressed mutant PS1.
These results suggest that the AD phenotypes, in particular, the electrophysiological abnormality of the synapses in our AD models might be useful for AD research and drug discovery."] 

26351257 Hierarchical Micro-Nano Surface Topography Promotes Long-Term Maintenance of Undifferentiated Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.
['Understanding of stem cell-surface interactions and, in particular, long-term maintenance of stem cell pluripotency on well-defined synthetic surfaces is crucial for fundamental research and biomedical applications of stem cells.
Here, we show that synthetic surfaces possessing hierarchical micro-nano roughness (MN-surfaces) promote long-term self-renewal (>3 weeks) of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as monitored by the expression levels of the pluripotency markers octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), Nanog, and alkaline phosphatase.
On the contrary, culturing of mESCs on either smooth (S-) or nanorough polymer surfaces (N-surfaces) leads to their fast differentiation.
Moreover, we show that regular passaging of mESCs on the hierarchical MN-polymer surface leads to an increased homogeneity and percentage of Oct4-positive stem cell colonies as compared to mESCs grown on fibroblast feeder cells.
Immunostaining revealed the absence of focal adhesion markers on all polymer substrates studied.
However, only the MN-surfaces elicited the formation of actin-positive cell protrusions, indicating an alternative anchorage mechanism involved in the maintenance of mESC stemness.'] 

25950719 Derivation and characterization of human embryonic stem cells on human amnion epithelial cells.
['Culture conditions that support the growth of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have already been established using primary human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) as an alternative to traditional mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
In the present work, inner cell masses (ICM) were isolated from frozen embryos obtained as donations from couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment and four new hESC lines were derived using hAECs as feeder cells.
This feeder system was able to support continuous growth of what were, according to their domed shape and markers, undifferentiated naïve-like hESCs.
Their pluripotent potential were also demonstrated by embryoid bodies developing to the expected three germ layers in vitro and the productions of teratoma in vivo.
The cell lines retained their karyotypic integrity for over 35 passages.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that these newly derived hESCs consisted mostly of undifferentiated cells with large nuclei and scanty cytoplasm.
The new hESCs cultured on hAECs showed distinct undifferentiated characteristics in comparison to hESCs of the same passage maintained on MEFs.
This type of optimized culture system may provide a useful platform for establishing clinical-grade hESCs and assessing the undifferentiated potential of hESCs.'] 

24667642 An optimized and simplified system of mouse embryonic stem cell cardiac differentiation for the assessment of differentiation modifiers.
['Generating cardiomyocytes from embryonic stem cells is an important technique for understanding cardiovascular development, the origins of cardiovascular diseases and also for providing potential reagents for cardiac repair.
Numerous methods have been published but often are technically challenging, complex, and are not easily adapted to assessment of specific gene contributions to cardiac myocyte differentiation.
Here we report the development of an optimized protocol to induce the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to cardiac myocytes that is simplified and easily adapted for genetic studies.
Specifically, we made four critical findings that distinguish our protocol: 1) mouse embryonic stem cells cultured in media containing CHIR99021 and PD0325901 to maintain pluripotency will efficiently form embryoid bodies containing precardiac mesoderm when cultured in these factors at a reduced dosage, 2) low serum conditions promote cardiomyocyte differentiation and can be used in place of commercially prepared StemPro nutrient supplement, 3) the Wnt inhibitor Dkk-1 is dispensable for efficient cardiac differentiation and 4) tracking differentiation efficiency may be done with surface expression of PDGFRα alone.
In addition, cardiac mesodermal precursors generated by this system can undergo lentiviral infection to manipulate the expression of specific target molecules to assess effects on cardiac myocyte differentiation and maturation.
Using this approach, we assessed the effects of CHF1/Hey2 on cardiac myocyte differentiation, using both gain and loss of function.
Overexpression of CHF1/Hey2 at the cardiac mesoderm stage had no apparent effect on cardiac differentiation, while knockdown of CHF1/Hey2 resulted in increased expression of atrial natriuretic factor and connexin 43, suggesting an alteration in the phenotype of the cardiomyocytes.
In summary we have generated a detailed and simplified protocol for generating cardiomyocytes from mES cells that is optimized for investigating factors that affect cardiac differentiation.'] 

24044751 Structure and barrier properties of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells are affected by extracellular matrix protein coating.
["Extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions play a vital role in cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of cells.
We investigated the role of ECM proteins on the structure and function of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells during their differentiation and maturation from hESCs into RPE cells in adherent differentiation cultures on several human ECM proteins found in native human Bruch's membrane, namely, collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin, as well as on commercial substrates of xeno-free CELLstart™ and Matrigel™. Cell pigmentation, expression of RPE-specific proteins, fine structure, as well as the production of basal lamina by hESC-RPE on different protein coatings were evaluated after 140 days of differentiation.
The integrity of hESC-RPE epithelium and barrier properties on different coatings were investigated by measuring transepithelial resistance.
All coatings supported the differentiation of hESC-RPE cells as demonstrated by early onset of cell pigmentation and further maturation to RPE monolayers after enrichment.
Mature RPE phenotype was verified by RPE-specific gene and protein expression, correct epithelial polarization, and phagocytic activity.
Significant differences were found in the degree of RPE cell pigmentation and tightness of epithelial barrier between different coatings.
Further, the thickness of self-assembled basal lamina and secretion of the key ECM proteins found in the basement membrane of the native RPE varied between hESC-RPE cultured on compared protein coatings.
In conclusion, this study shows that the cell culture substrate has a major effect on the structure and basal lamina production during the differentiation and maturation of hESC-RPE potentially influencing the success of cell integrations and survival after cell transplantation."]

23712629 High throughput screening for inhibitors of REST in neural derivatives of human embryonic stem cells reveals a chemical compound that promotes expression of neuronal genes.
['Decreased expression of neuronal genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with several neurological disorders.
One molecular mechanism associated with Huntington disease (HD) is a discrete increase in the nuclear activity of the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF binding to repressor element-1 (RE1) sequences.
High-throughput screening of a library of 6,984 compounds with luciferase-assay measuring REST activity in neural derivatives of human embryonic stem cells led to identify two benzoimidazole-5-carboxamide derivatives that inhibited REST silencing in a RE1-dependent manner.
The most potent compound, X5050, targeted REST degradation, but neither REST expression, RNA splicing nor binding to RE1 sequence.
Differential transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of neuronal genes targeted by REST in wild-type neural cells treated with X5050.
This activity was confirmed in neural cells produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a HD patient.
Acute intraventricular delivery of X5050 increased the expressions of BDNF and several other REST-regulated genes in the prefrontal cortex of mice with quinolinate-induced striatal lesions.
This study demonstrates that the use of pluripotent stem cell derivatives can represent a crucial step toward the identification of pharmacological compounds with therapeutic potential in neurological affections involving decreased expression of neuronal genes associated to increased REST activity, such as Huntington disease.'] 

23922318 Molecular functions of the LIM-homeobox transcription factor Lhx2 in hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells.
['We previously demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like cells are robustly expanded from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by enforced expression of Lhx2, a LIM-homeobox domain (LIM-HD) transcription factor.
In this study, we analyzed the functions of Lhx2 in that process using an ESC line harboring an inducible Lhx2 gene cassette.
When ESCs are cultured on OP9 stromal cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are differentiated and these HPCs are prone to undergo rapid differentiation into mature hematopoietic cells.
Lhx2 inhibited differentiation of HPCs into mature hematopoietic cells and this effect would lead to accumulation of HSC-like cells.
LIM-HD factors interact with LIM domain binding (Ldb) protein and this interaction abrogates binding of LIM-only (Lmo) protein to Ldb.
We found that one of Lmo protein, Lmo2, was unstable due to dissociation of Lmo2 from Ldb1 in the presence of Lhx2.
This effect of Lhx2 on the amount of Lmo2 contributed into accumulation of HSC-like cells, since enforced expression of Lmo2 into HSC-like cells inhibited their self-renewal.
Expression of Gata3 and Tal1/Scl was increased in HSC-like cells and enforced expression of Lmo2 reduced expression of Gata3 but not Tal1/Scl.
Enforced expression of Gata3 into HPCs inhibited mature hematopoietic cell differentiation, whereas Gata3-knockdown abrogated the Lhx2-mediated expansion of HPCs.
We propose that multiple transcription factors/cofactors are involved in the Lhx2-mediated expansion of HSC-like cells from ESCs.
Lhx2 appears to fine-tune the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSC-like cells.']

24521543 Essential role of lncRNA binding for WDR5 maintenance of active chromatin and embryonic stem cell pluripotency.
['The WDR5 subunit of the MLL complex enforces active chromatin and can bind RNA; the relationship between these two activities is unclear.
Here we identify a RNA binding pocket on WDR5, and discover a WDR5 mutant (F266A) that selectively abrogates RNA binding without affecting MLL complex assembly or catalytic activity.
Complementation in ESCs shows that WDR5 F266A mutant is unable to accumulate on chromatin, and is defective in gene activation, maintenance of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, and ESC self renewal.
We identify a family of ESC messenger and lncRNAs that interact with wild type WDR5 but not F266A mutant, including several lncRNAs known to be important for ESC gene expression.
These results suggest that specific RNAs are integral inputs into the WDR5-MLL complex for maintenance of the active chromatin state and embryonic stem cell fates.

We exposed human embryonic stem cells (with and without know DNA mutations) to a low concentration (20 mM) of ethanol and measured neurosphere proliferation and differentiation, glial protein levels, expression of various cell-cycle genes, and DNA methylation.

25477174 Engraftable neural crest stem cells derived from cynomolgus monkey embryonic stem cells.
['Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), a population of multipotent cells that migrate extensively and give rise to diverse derivatives, including peripheral and enteric neurons and glia, craniofacial cartilage and bone, melanocytes and smooth muscle, have great potential for regenerative medicine.
Non-human primates provide optimal models for the development of stem cell therapies.
Here, we describe the first derivation of NCSCs from cynomolgus monkey embryonic stem cells (CmESCs) at the neural rosette stage.
CmESC-derived neurospheres replated on polyornithine/laminin-coated dishes migrated onto the substrate and showed characteristic expression of NCSC markers, including Sox10, AP2α, Slug, Nestin, p75, and HNK1.
CmNCSCs were capable of propagating in an undifferentiated state in\xa0vitro as adherent or suspension cultures, and could be subsequently induced to differentiate towards peripheral nervous system lineages (peripheral sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and Schwann cells) and mesenchymal lineages (osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells).
CmNCSCs transplanted into developing chick embryos or fetal brains of cynomolgus macaques survived, migrated, and differentiated into progeny consistent with a neural crest identity.
Our studies demonstrate that CmNCSCs offer a new tool for investigating neural crest development and neural crest-associated human disease and suggest that this non-human primate model may facilitate tissue engineering and regenerative medicine efforts.'] 

24974101 PSA-NCAM(+) neural precursor cells from human embryonic stem cells promote neural tissue integrity and behavioral performance in a rat stroke model.
['Recently, cell-based therapy has been highlighted as an alternative to treating ischemic brain damage in stroke patients.
The present study addresses the therapeutic potential of polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-positive neural precursor cells (NPC(PSA-NCAM+)) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a rat stroke model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Data showed that rats transplanted with NPC(PSA-NCAM+) are superior to those treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in behavioral performance throughout time points.
In order to investigate its underlying events, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on rat ischemic brains treated with PBS, MSCs, and NPC(PSA-NCAM+).
Unlike MSCs, NPC(PSA-NCAM+) demonstrated a potent immunoreactivity against human specific nuclei, doublecortin, and Tuj1 at day 26 post-transplantation, implying their survival, differentiation, and integration in the host brain.
Significantly, NPC(PSA-NCAM+) evidently lowered the positivity of microglial ED-1 and astrocytic GFAP, suggesting a suppression of adverse glial activation in the host brain.
In addition, NPC(PSA-NCAM+) elevated α-SMA(+)
immunoreactivity and the expression of angiopoietin-1 indicating angiogenic stimulation in the host brain.
Taken together, the current data demonstrate that transplanted NPC(PSA-NCAM+) preserve brain tissue with reduced infarct size and improve behavioral performance through actions encompassing anti-reactive glial activation and pro-angiogenic activity in a rat stroke model.
In conclusion, the present findings support the potentiality of NPC(PSA-NCAM+) as the promising source in the development of cell-based therapy for neurological diseases including ischemic stroke.'] 

25200136 Olig2 overexpression accelerates the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro.
['Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) transplantation is receiving considerable attention in the field of regenerative medicine therapy for demyelinating diseases.
Although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been successfully induced to differentiate into OPCs with cytokines cocktails in vitro, the regulatory roles of many key transcription factors in this process are not clear.
Here, we introduced oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (Olig2), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to investigate its effects on the differentiation of mESCs into OPCs.
The results showed that Olig2 overexpression alone did not affect pluripotency of mESCs, but in the stimulation of differentiating cocktails, Olig2 accelerated mESCs to differentiate into OPCs, shortening the induction time span from normal 21 days to 11 days.
Further study demonstrated the Olig2-mESCs derived OPCs were able to differentiate into C-type natriuretic peptid (CNP) and Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) positive mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in vitro, suggesting these induced OPCs might be favorable for myelin regeneration in vivo.'] 

25446531 Gro/TLE enables embryonic stem cell differentiation by repressing pluripotent gene expression.
['Gro/TLE proteins (TLE1-4) are a family of transcriptional corepressors acting downstream of multiple signalling pathways.
Several TLEs are expressed in a dynamic manner throughout embryonic development and at high levels in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Here we find that Gro/TLE is not required in ESC for sustaining pluripotency and suppressing differentiation genes, but rather is important for the shutting down of the pluripotency network in differentiation.
Consistent with this view, we found that one of the Gro/TLE family, TLE4 is expressed heterogeneously in ESCs in a population that corresponds to a Nanog low subset of ESC culture.
TLE4 expression is also increased in response to LIF withdrawal and Fgf/Mek/Erk stimulation.
To explore the role of Gro/TLE in more detail we generated an allelic series of knockout ESCs of two TLE genes expressed most dynamically in early differentiation, TLE3 and TLE4.
Genetic reduction in TLE dose resulted in an increase in the expression of pluripotency markers and inhibition of ESC differentiation towards both epiblast and endoderm lineages.
Overexpression of a drug inducible TLE4 could both rescue TLE3/TLE4 compound phenotypes and induce early expression of endoderm (Hhex-Venus) and neural (Sox1-GFP) reporter genes.
Taken together, our results suggest that TLE activity is essential for early differentiation where it acts to suppress the pluripotency network, allowing for the initiation of lineage specific gene expression programs.'] 

25206669 Differentiation of neuron-like cells from mouse parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells.
['Parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells have pluripotent differentiation potentials, akin to fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.
The aim of this study was to compare the neuronal differentiation potential of parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.
Before differentiation, karyotype analysis was performed, with normal karyotypes detected in both parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.
Sex chromosomes were identified as XX. Immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR detected high expression of the pluripotent gene, Oct4, at both the mRNA and protein levels, indicating pluripotent differentiation potential of the two embryonic stem cell subtypes.
Embryonic stem cells were induced with retinoic acid to form embryoid bodies, and then dispersed into single cells.
Single cells were differentiated in N2 differentiation medium for 9 days.
Immunocytochemistry showed parthenogenetic and fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells both express the neuronal cell markers nestin, βIII-tubulin and myelin basic protein.
Quantitative real-time PCR found expression of neurogenesis related genes (Sox-1, Nestin, GABA, Pax6, Zic5 and Pitx1) in both types of embryonic stem cells, and Oct4 expression was significantly decreased.
Nestin and Pax6 expression in parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells was significantly higher than that in fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.
Thus, our experimental findings indicate that parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells have stronger neuronal differentiation potential than fertilized embryo-derived embryonic stem cells.'] 

26190528 Embryonic Stem Cells License a High Level of Dormant Origins to Protect the Genome against Replication Stress.
['Maintaining genomic integrity during DNA replication is essential for stem cells.
DNA replication origins are licensed by the MCM2-7 complexes, with most of them remaining dormant.
Dormant origins (DOs) rescue replication fork stalling in S phase and ensure genome integrity.
However, it is not known whether DOs exist and play important roles in any stem cell type.
Here, we show that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) contain more DOs than tissue stem/progenitor cells such as neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs).
Partial depletion of DOs does not affect ESC self-renewal but impairs their differentiation, including toward the neural lineage.
However, reduction of DOs in NSPCs impairs their self-renewal due to accumulation of DNA damage and apoptosis.
Furthermore, mice with reduced DOs show abnormal neurogenesis and semi-embryonic lethality.
Our results reveal that ESCs are equipped with more DOs to better protect against replicative stress than tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells.'] 

24879426 The effects of triclosan on pluripotency factors and development of mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish.
["Triclosan (TCS) poses potential risks to reproduction and development due to its endocrine-disrupting properties.
However, the mechanism of TCS's effects on early embryonic development is little known.
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) and zebrafish embryos provide valuable models for testing the toxic effects of environmental chemicals on early embryogenesis.
In this study, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were acutely exposed to TCS for 24 h, and general cytotoxicity and the effect of TCS on pluripotency were then evaluated.
In addition, zebrafish embryos were exposed to TCS from 2- to 24-h post-fertilization (hpf), and their morphology was evaluated.
In mESC, alkaline phosphatase staining was significantly decreased after treatment with the highest concentration of TCS (50 μM).
Although the expression levels of Sox2 mRNA were not changed, the mRNA levels of Oct4 and Nanog in TCS-treated groups were significantly decreased compared to controls.
In addition, the protein levels of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog were significantly reduced in response to TCS treatment.
MicroRNA (miR)-134, an expression inhibitor of pluripotency markers, was significantly increased in TCS-treated mESC.
In zebrafish experiments, after 24 hpf of treatment, the controls had developed to the late stage of somitogenesis, while embryos exposed to 300 μg/L of TCS were still at the early stage of somitogenesis, and three genes (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) were upregulated in treated groups when compared with the controls.
The two models demonstrated that TCS may affect early embryonic development by disturbing the expression of the pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog)."] 

25593208 Defined culture of human embryonic stem cells and xeno-free derivation of retinal pigmented epithelial cells on a novel, synthetic substrate.
['Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, is characterized by the death of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), which is a monolayer posterior to the retina that supports the photoreceptors.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can generate an unlimited source of RPE for cellular therapies, and clinical trials have been initiated.
However, protocols for RPE derivation using defined conditions free of nonhuman derivatives (xeno-free) are preferred for clinical translation.
This avoids exposing AMD patients to animal-derived products, which could incite an immune response.
In this study, we investigated the maintenance of hESCs and their differentiation into RPE using Synthemax II-SC, which is a novel, synthetic animal-derived component-free, RGD peptide-containing copolymer compliant with good manufacturing practices designed for xeno-free stem cell culture.
Cells on Synthemax II-SC were compared with cultures grown with xenogeneic and xeno-free control substrates.
This report demonstrates that Synthemax II-SC supports long-term culture of H9 and H14 hESC lines and permits efficient differentiation of hESCs into functional RPE. Expression of RPE-specific markers was assessed by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunocytochemistry, and RPE function was determined by phagocytosis of rod outer segments and secretion of pigment epithelium-derived factor.
Both hESCs and hESC-RPE maintained normal karyotypes after long-term culture on Synthemax II-SC.
Furthermore, RPE generated on Synthemax II-SC are functional when seeded onto parylene-C scaffolds designed for clinical use.
These experiments suggest that Synthemax II-SC is a suitable, defined substrate for hESC culture and the xeno-free derivation of RPE for cellular therapies.'] 

25447493 Detection of embryonic stem cell lysate biomarkers by surface plasmon resonance with reduced nonspecific adsorption.
['Surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) has emerged as a versatile biosensor to detect a wide range of biomolecular interactions with divergent potential applications.
However, the use of this advanced-level technology for stem cell lysate study is still not much explored.
Cell lysates are significant biological analytes used for disease diagnostics and proteomic studies, but their complex nature limits their use as an analyte for SPRi biosensors.
Here, we review the problems associated with the use of SPRi for stem cell lysate study and examine the role of surface chemistry, running buffer, and blocking solution in order to minimize nonspecific adsorption (NSA).
We detect the expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Rex1, and Lin28 biomarkers present in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lysate against their corresponding antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface with reduced NSA.
The current study shows that the conjunction of SPRi and microarray can be used as a label-free, high-throughput, and rapid technique for detection of biomarkers and their relative abundance in stem cell lysate study.'] 

24598818 Mesenchymal morphogenesis of embryonic stem cells dynamically modulates the biophysical microtissue niche.
['Stem cell fate and function are dynamically modulated by the interdependent relationships between biochemical and biophysical signals constituting the local 3D microenvironment.
While approaches to recapitulate the stem cell niche have been explored for directing stem cell differentiation, a quantitative relationship between embryonic stem cell (ESC) morphogenesis and intrinsic biophysical cues within three-dimensional microtissues has not been established.
In this study, we demonstrate that mesenchymal embryonic microtissues induced by BMP4 exhibited increased stiffness and viscosity accompanying differentiation, with cytoskeletal tension significantly contributing to multicellular stiffness.
Perturbation of the cytoskeleton during ESC differentiation led to modulation of the biomechanical and gene expression profiles, with the resulting cell phenotype and biophysical properties being highly correlated by multivariate analyses.
Together, this study elucidates the dynamics of biophysical and biochemical signatures within embryonic microenvironments, with broad implications for monitoring tissue dynamics, modeling pathophysiological and embryonic morphogenesis and directing stem cell patterning and differentiation.'] 

26416684 Progressing a human embryonic stem-cell-based regenerative medicine therapy towards the clinic.

Despite significant resources in this direction, the path to the clinic for an embryonic stem-cell-based regenerative medicine therapy has not proven straightforward, though in the past few years progress has been made.

24780625 Huntingtin protein is essential for mitochondrial metabolism, bioenergetics and structure in murine embryonic stem cells.
["Mutations in the Huntington locus (htt) have devastating consequences.
Gain-of-poly-Q repeats in Htt protein causes Huntington's disease (HD), while htt(-/-) mutants display early embryonic lethality.
Despite its importance, the function of Htt remains elusive.
To address this, we compared more than 3700 compounds in three syngeneic mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines: htt(-/-), extended poly-Q (Htt-Q140/7), and wild-type mESCs (Htt-Q7/7) using untargeted metabolite profiling.
While Htt-Q140/7 cells did not show major differences in cellular bioenergetics, we find extensive metabolic aberrations in htt(-/-) mESCs, including (i) complete failure of ATP production despite preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential; (ii) near-maximal glycolysis, with little or no glycolytic reserve; (iii) marked ketogenesis; (iv) depletion of intracellular NTPs; (v) accelerated purine biosynthesis and salvage; and (vi) loss of mitochondrial structural integrity.
Together, our findings reveal that Htt is necessary for mitochondrial structure and function from the earliest stages of embryogenesis, providing a molecular explanation for htt(-/-) early embryonic lethality."] 

25664506 Nuclear transcriptome profiling of induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells identify non-coding loci resistant to reprogramming.
['Identification of functionally relevant differences between induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and reference embryonic stem cells (ESC) remains a central question for therapeutic applications.
Differences in gene expression between iPSC and ESC have been examined by microarray and more recently with RNA-SEQ technologies.
We here report an in depth analyses of nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes, using the CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) technology, for 5 iPSC clones derived from mouse lymphocytes B and 3 ESC lines.
This approach reveals nuclear transcriptomes significantly more complex in ESC than in iPSC. Hundreds of yet not annotated putative non-coding RNAs and enhancer-associated transcripts specifically transcribed in ESC have been detected and supported with epigenetic and chromatin-chromatin interactions data.
We identified super-enhancers transcriptionally active specifically in ESC and associated with genes implicated in the maintenance of pluripotency.
Similarly, we detected non-coding transcripts of yet unknown function being regulated by ESC specific super-enhancers.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that current protocols of iPSC reprogramming do not trigger activation of numerous cis-regulatory regions.
It thus reinforces the need for already suggested deeper monitoring of the non-coding transcriptome when characterizing iPSC clones.
Such differences in regulatory transcript expression may indeed impact their potential for clinical applications.'] 

21770033 Temporal proteomic profiling of embryonic stem cell secretome during cardiac and neural differentiation.
['During recent years, increased efforts have focused on elucidating the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells.
Differentiation towards the different lineages has attracted significant attention given the potential use of stem cells in regenerative medicine.
Embryonic stem cell differentiation is a complex process coordinated by strictly regulated extracellular signals that act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner.
Through secreted molecules, stem cells affect local niche biology and influence the cross-talking with the surrounding tissues.
Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that fundamental cell functions, including proliferation and differentiation, are strictly regulated by the complex set of molecules secreted from cells.
The understanding of this molecular language could largely increase our knowledge on pathways regulating stem cell differentiation.
Here, we have used a proteomics platform to investigate the profile of proteins secreted during differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells.
We have followed the dynamics of protein secretion by comparing the secretomes at different time points of murine embryonic stem cell cardiac and neural differentiation.
In addition to previously reported molecules, we have identified many secreted proteins not described so far as released from embryonic stem cells nor shown to be differentially released during the process of cardiomyogenesis and neurogenesis.'] 

24465672 Comparative study of efficacy of dopaminergic neuron differentiation between embryonic stem cell and protein-based induced pluripotent stem cell.
["In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), stem cells can serve as therapeutic agents to restore or regenerate injured nervous system.
Here, we differentiated two types of stem cells; mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and protein-based iPS cells (P-iPSCs) generated by non-viral methods, into midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, and then compared the efficiency of DA neuron differentiation from these two cell types.
In the undifferentiated stage, P-iPSCs expressed pluripotency markers as ES cells did, indicating that protein-based reprogramming was stable and authentic.
While both stem cell types were differentiated to the terminally-matured mDA neurons, P-iPSCs showed higher DA neuron-specific markers' expression than ES cells.
To investigate the mechanism of the superior induction capacity of DA neurons observed in P-iPSCs compared to ES cells, we analyzed histone modifications by genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis and their corresponding microarray results between two cell types.
We found that Wnt signaling was up-regulated, while SFRP1, a counter-acting molecule of Wnt, was more suppressed in P-iPSCs than in mESCs.
In PD rat model, transplantation of neural precursor cells derived from both cell types showed improved function.
The present study demonstrates that P-iPSCs could be a suitable cell source to provide patient-specific therapy for PD without ethical problems or rejection issues."] 

23756999 Effective induction of cells expressing GABAergic neuronal markers from mouse embryonic stem cell.
['Successful derivations of specific neuronal and glial cells from embryonic stem cells have enormous potential for cell therapies and regenerative medicine.
However, the low efficiency, the complexity of induction method, and the need for purification represent obstacles that make their application impractical.
In this study, we found that PDGFRα(+) cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) can serve as a useful source from which to induce cells that express γ-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)-releasing (GABAergic) neuronal markers.
PDGFRα(+) cells were induced from mESC on collagen IV-coated plates in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture medium with limited exposure to retinoic acid, sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and maintained in MSC culture medium containing Y-27632, a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor.
We found that supplementation of vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-basic, and sodium azide (NaN3) to MSC culture medium effectively differentiated PDGFRα(+) cells into cells that express GABAergic neuronal markers, such as Pax2, Dlx2, GAD67 NCAM, and tubulin-βIII, while markers for oligodendrocyte (Sox2) and astrocyte (Glast) were suppressed.
Immunostaining for GABA showed the majority (86\u2009±\u20095%) of the induced cells were GABA-positive.
We also found that the PDGFRα(+) cells retained such differentiation potential even after more than ten passages and cryopreservation.
In summary, this study presents a simple and highly efficient method of inducing cells that express GABAergic neuronal markers from mESC. Together with its ease of maintenance in vitro, PDGFRα(+) cells derived from mESC may serve as a useful source for such purpose.'] 

25946229 Surface Modified Biodegradable Electrospun Membranes as a Carrier for Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.
['Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells are currently undergoing clinical trials to treat retinal degenerative diseases.
Transplantation of hESC-RPE cells in conjuction with a supportive biomaterial carrier holds great potential as a future treatment for retinal degeneration.
However, there has been no such biodegradable material that could support the growth and maturation of hESC-RPE cells so far.
The primary aim of this work was to create a thin porous poly (L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) membrane that could promote attachment, proliferation, and maturation of the hESC-RPE cells in serum-free culture conditions.
The PLCL membranes were modified by atmospheric pressure plasma processing and coated with collagen IV to enhance cell growth and maturation.
Permeability of the membranes was analyzed with an Ussing chamber system.
Analysis with scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that plasma surface treatment augments the surface properties of the membrane, which enhances the binding and conformation of the protein.
Cell proliferation assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluoresence staining, trans-epithelial electrical resistance measurements, and in vitro phagocytosis assay clearly demonstrated that the plasma treated PLCL membranes supported the adherence, proliferation, maturation and functionality of hESC-RPE cells in serum-free culture conditions.
Here, we report for the first time, how PLCL membranes can be modified with atmospheric pressure plasma processing to enable the formation of a functional hESC-RPE monolayer on a porous biodegradable substrate, which have a potential as a tissue-engineered construct for regenerative retinal repair applications.'] 

24955741 Generation of multipotent early lymphoid progenitors from human embryonic stem cells.
['During human embryonic stem cell (ESC) hematopoietic differentiation, the description of the initial steps of lymphopoiesis remains elusive.
Using a two-step culture procedure, we identified two original populations of ESC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(-) and CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+) phenotypes.
Bulk cultures and limiting dilution assays, culture with MS5 cells in the presence of Notch ligand Delta-like-1 (DL-1), and ex vivo colonization tests using fetal thymic organ cultures showed that although CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(-) HPCs could generate cells of the three lymphoid lineages, their potential was skewed toward the B cell lineages.
In contrast, CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+)
HPCs predominantly exhibited a T/natural killer (NK) cell differentiation potential.
Furthermore these cells could differentiate equivalently into cells of the granulo-macrophagic lineage and dendritic cells and lacked erythroid potential.
Expression profiling of 18 markers by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(-) and CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+) HPCs express genes of the lymphoid specification and that CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(-) cells express B-cell-associated genes, while CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+)
HPCs display a T-cell molecular profile.
Altogether, these findings indicate that CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(-) and CD34(+)CD45RA(+)CD7(+)
HPCs correspond to candidate multipotent early lymphoid progenitors polarized toward either the B or T/NK lineage, respectively.
This work should improve our understanding of the early steps of lymphopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells and pave the way for the production of lymphocytes for cell-based immunotherapy and lymphoid development studies.']

25335858 Notch signaling regulates motor neuron differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.
['In the pMN domain of the spinal cord, Notch signaling regulates the balance between motor neuron differentiation and maintenance of the progenitor state for later oligodendrocyte differentiation.
Here, we sought to study the role of Notch signaling in regulation of the switch from the pMN progenitor state to differentiated motor neurons in a human model system.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were directed to differentiate to pMN-like progenitor cells by the inductive action of retinoic acid and a Shh agonist, purmorphamine.
We found that the expression of the Notch signaling effector Hes5 was induced in hESC-derived pMN-like progenitors and remained highly expressed when they were cultured under conditions favoring motor neuron differentiation.
Inhibition of Notch signaling by a γ-secretase inhibitor in the differentiating pMN-like progenitor cells decreased Hes5 expression and enhanced the differentiation toward motor neurons.
Conversely, over-expression of Hes5 in pMN-like progenitor cells during the differentiation interfered with retinoic acid- and purmorphamine-induced motor neuron differentiation and inhibited the emergence of motor neurons.
Inhibition of Notch signaling had a permissive rather than an inductive effect on motor neuron differentiation.
Our results indicate that Notch signaling has a regulatory role in the switch from the pMN progenitor to the differentiated motor neuron state.
Inhibition of Notch signaling can be harnessed to enhance the differentiation of hESCs toward motor neurons.'] 

24192059 Immunosuppressive agents modulate function, growth, and survival of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.
['Cardiac cell replacement therapy by using human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivatives remains a potential approach to regenerate myocardium.
The major hurdles to clinical application of this technology are immunogenicity and post-transplantation cell death.
Here we examined the effects of calcineurin-targeting immunosuppressants cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506, as well as rapamycin and a selective inhibitor of calcineurin-binding downstream nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) transcription factor VIVIT on the proliferative activity, function, and survival of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) and endothelial cells (hESC-EC) in culture.
As shown by automated microscopy, treatments with CsA, FK506, and rapamycin all decreased proliferation, reducing the percentage of hESC-CM and hESC-EC with the mitotic marker Ki67(+) by as much as 60% and 74%, respectively.
Administration of the cell permeable analogue 11R-VIVIT protein did not modulate their proliferative activity.
All immunosuppressants reversed the proapoptotic effect of chelerythrine in hESC-CM demonstrating an inhibitory role of calcineurin/NFAT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways in hESC-CM survival (using apoptotic marker caspase-3), whereas the protection was less obvious in hESC-EC exposed to H2O2.
Immunosuppressants did not affect cell viability in hESC-EC. Our results show that immunosuppressants reduce proliferation, while offsetting cell loss to a smaller extent by reduction in apoptosis of hESC-CM. Immunosuppressant therapy would be compatible with stem cell transplantation, but the resulting reduction in graft expansion capabilities would potentially necessitate implantation of increased cell numbers when immunosuppressants are given.
The effects of NFAT-binding immunosuppressant molecules, which do not affect hESC-CM proliferation, may point the way forward for new classes of compounds better suited to cell implantation.'] 

23760504 The epigenetic modifier ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) regulates embryonic stem cell differentiation via transcriptional repression of sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2).
['Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo self-renewal until stimulated to differentiate along specific lineage pathways.
Many of the transcriptional networks that drive reprogramming of a self-renewing ESC to a differentiating cell have been identified.
However, fundamental questions remain unanswered about the epigenetic programs that control these changes in gene expression.
Here we report that the histone ubiquitin hydrolase ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) is a critical epigenetic modifier that controls this transition from self-renewal to differentiation.
USP22 is induced as ESCs differentiate and is necessary for differentiation into all three germ layers.
We further report that USP22 is a transcriptional repressor of the locus encoding the core pluripotency factor sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) in ESCs, and this repression is required for efficient differentiation.
USP22 occupies the Sox2 promoter and hydrolyzes monoubiquitin from ubiquitylated histone H2B and blocks transcription of the Sox2 locus.
Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism that represses the core pluripotency transcriptional network in ESCs, allowing ESCs to transition from a state of self-renewal into lineage-specific differentiation programs.']

Stable transgenic hESCs (H1) and ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 were established before fusion, and cell fusion system was established to analyse the related indicators.
PTEN expression in HO-H1 cells was higher than those in the parental stem cells and lower than those in parental tumour cells; the growth of OV-H1 (RFP+GFP) hybrid cells with double fluorescence expressions were obviously slower than that of human embryonic stem cells and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells.
The apoptosis signal of the OV-H1 hybrid cells was significantly higher than that of the hESCs and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells.
In\xa0vivo results showed that compared with 7\xa0days, 28\xa0days and 35\xa0days after inoculation of OV-H1 hybrid cells; also, apoptotic cell detection indicated that much stronger apoptotic signal was found in OV-H1 hybrid cells inoculated mouse.
The hESCs can inhibit the growth of OVCAR-3 cells in\xa0vitro by suppressing p53 and PTEN expression to suppress the growth of tumour that may be achieved by inducing apoptosis of OVCAR-3 cells.
The change of epigenetics after fusion of ovarian cancer cells and hESCs may become a novel direction for treatment of ovarian cancer.']

24089415 Delivery of differentiation factors by mesoporous silica particles assists advanced differentiation of transplanted murine embryonic stem cells.
['Stem cell transplantation holds great hope for the replacement of damaged cells in the nervous system.
However, poor long-term survival after transplantation and insufficiently robust differentiation of stem cells into specialized cell types in vivo remain major obstacles for clinical application.
Here, we report the development of a novel technological approach for the local delivery of exogenous trophic factor mimetics to transplanted cells using specifically designed silica nanoporous particles.
We demonstrated that delivering Cintrofin and Gliafin, established peptide mimetics of the ciliary neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, respectively, with these particles enabled not only robust functional differentiation of motor neurons from transplanted embryonic stem cells but also their long-term survival in vivo.
We propose that the delivery of growth factors by mesoporous nanoparticles is a potentially versatile and widely applicable strategy for efficient differentiation and functional integration of stem cell derivatives upon transplantation.'] 

24286027 Functional differences in engineered myocardium from embryonic stem cell-derived versus neonatal cardiomyocytes.
['Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes represent unique tools for cell- and tissue-based regenerative therapies, drug discovery and safety, and studies of fundamental heart-failure mechanisms.
However, the degree to which stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes compare to mature cardiomyocytes is often debated.
We reasoned that physiological metrics of engineered cardiac tissues offer a means of comparison.
We built laminar myocardium engineered from cardiomyocytes that were differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors or harvested directly from neonatal mouse ventricles, and compared their anatomy and physiology in\xa0vitro.
Tissues assembled from progenitor-derived myocytes and neonate myocytes demonstrated similar cytoskeletal architectures but different gap junction organization and electromechanical properties.
Progenitor-derived myocardium had significantly less contractile stress and slower longitudinal conduction velocity than neonate-derived myocardium, indicating that the developmental state of the cardiomyocytes affects the electromechanical function of the resultant engineered tissue.
These data suggest a need to establish performance metrics for future stem cell applications.'] 

24892988 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells promote lymphohematopoietic differentiation from murine embryonic stem cells: role of soluble factors.
['Liver sinusoid endothelial cells (LSEC) constitute an in vitro and in vivo microenvironment for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).
Previously, we have shown that LSEC support the survival and growth of murine embryonic stem cells (ESC).
In this study, we investigated the capacity of LSEC to promote hematopoietic differentiation from the murine ESC cell line, CGR8.
Undifferentiated ESC were cultured on LSEC monolayers in the absence of exogenous cytokines.
After 10 and 20 days, cells were harvested and examined by their morphology, phenotype and capacity of hematopoietic colony formation.
Microscopic observation of LSEC/ESC cocultures showed the presence of cobblestone areas formation, which indicates active hematopoiesis.
Morphological analysis of cell from these foci showed the presence of hematopoietic cells at different stages of differentiation.
Cells expressing B lymphoid markers (B220 and
CD19) were detected by flow cytometry, and clonogenic assays showed the formation of CFU-pre B colonies.
Similar results were observed when ESC were cultured with LSEC conditioned media.
Myeloid precursors were also detected by the presence of CFU-GM colonies and cells expressing myeloid markers.
These results indicate that LSEC provided an in vitro microenvironment mainly for B cell development, but also myeloid differentiation from ESC. Coculture of ESC with LSEC may constitute a very powerful tool to study the mechanisms involved in B cell generation from ESC.'] 

22307056 ERK1 and ERK2 regulate embryonic stem cell self-renewal through phosphorylation of Klf4.
['Understanding and controlling the mechanism by which stem cells balance self-renewal versus differentiation is of great importance for stem cell therapeutics.
Klf4 promotes the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, but the precise mechanism regulating this role of Klf4 is unclear.
We found that ERK1 or ERK2 binds the activation domain of Klf4 and directly phosphorylates Klf4 at Ser123.
This phosphorylation suppresses Klf4 activity, inducing embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Conversely, inhibition of Klf4 phosphorylation enhances Klf4 activity and suppresses embryonic stem cell differentiation.
Notably, phosphorylation of Klf4 by ERKs causes recruitment and binding of the F-box proteins βTrCP1 or βTrCP2 (components of an ubiquitin E3 ligase) to the Klf4 N-terminal domain, which results in Klf4 ubiquitination and degradation.
Overall, our data provide a molecular basis for the role of ERK1 and ERK2 in regulating Klf4-mediated mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal.']

24493854 Prospectively isolated NGN3-expressing progenitors from human embryonic stem cells give rise to pancreatic endocrine cells.
["Pancreatic endocrine progenitors obtained from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a promising source to develop cell-based therapies for diabetes.
Although endocrine pancreas progenitor cells have been isolated from mouse pancreata on the basis of Ngn3 expression, human endocrine progenitors have not been isolated yet.
As substantial differences exist between human and murine pancreas biology, we investigated whether it is possible to isolate pancreatic endocrine progenitors from differentiating hESC cultures by lineage tracing of NGN3.
We targeted the 3' end of NGN3 using zinc finger nuclease-mediated homologous recombination to allow selection of NGN3eGFP(+) cells without disrupting the coding sequence of the gene.
Isolated NGN3eGFP(+) cells express PDX1, NKX6.1, and chromogranin A and differentiate in vivo toward insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin single hormone-expressing cells but not to ductal or exocrine pancreatic cells or other endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal lineages.
This confirms that NGN3(+) cells represent pancreatic endocrine progenitors in humans.
In addition, this hESC reporter line constitutes a unique tool that may aid in gaining insight into the developmental mechanisms underlying fate choices in human pancreas and in developing cell-based therapies."] 

25523141 Mitochondrial function contributes to oxysterol-induced osteogenic differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, are biologically active molecules.
Specific oxysterols have potent osteogenic properties that act on osteoprogenitor cells.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these osteoinductive effects on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unknown.
This study investigated the effect of an oxysterol combination of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (SS) on osteogenic differentiation of ESCs and the alterations to mitochondrial activity during differentiation.
Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, matrix mineralization, mRNA expression of osteogenic factors, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin, and protein levels of collagen type IA (COLIA) and osteopontin (OPN).
Treatment of cells with SS increased osteoinductive activity compared to the control group.
Intracellular reactive oxygen species production, intracellular ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivators 1α and β, transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, were significantly increased during osteogenesis, indicating upregulation of mitochondrial activity.
Oxysterol combinations also increased protein levels of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I-V. We also found that SS treatment increased hedgehog signaling target genes, Smo and Gli1 expression.
Inhibition of Hh signaling by cyclopamine suppressed mitochondrial biogenesis and ESC osteogenesis.
Subsequently, oxysterol-induced Wnt/β-catenin pathways were inhibited by repression of Hh signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis.
Transfection of β-catenin specific siRNA decreased the protein levels of COLIA and OPN, as well as ALP activity.
Collectively, these data suggest that lipid-based oxysterols enhance differentiation of ESCs toward the osteogenic lineage by regulating mitochondrial activity, canonical Hh/Gli, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.'] 

21425958 Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells as cellular delivery vehicles for prodrug gene therapy of glioblastoma.
['Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess tumor-tropic properties and consequently have been used to deliver therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.
Their potential in cancer therapy highlights the need for a consistent and renewable source for the production of uniform human MSCs suitable for clinical applications.
In this study, we seek to investigate whether human embryonic stem cells can be used as a cell source to fulfill this goal.
We generated MSC-like cells from two human embryonic stem cell lines, HuES9 and H1, and observed that MSC-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells were able to migrate into human glioma intracranial xenografts after being injected into the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the tumor inoculation site.
We engineered these cells with baculoviral and lentiviral vectors, respectively, for transient and stable expression of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene.
In tumor-bearing mice the engineered MSC-like cells were capable of inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival in the presence of ganciclovir after they were injected either directly into the xenografts or into the opposite hemisphere.
Our findings suggest that human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs may be a viable and attractive alternative for large-scale derivation of targeting vehicles for cancer therapy.'] 

25741724 Area-specific reestablishment of damaged circuits in the adult cerebral cortex by cortical neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons constitute an attractive source for replacement therapies, but their utility remains unclear for cortical diseases.
Here, we show that neurons of visual cortex identity, differentiated in\xa0vitro from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), can be transplanted successfully following a lesion of the adult mouse visual cortex.
Reestablishment of the damaged pathways included long-range and reciprocal axonal projections and synaptic connections with targets of the damaged cortex.
Electrophysiological recordings revealed that some grafted neurons were functional and responsive to\xa0visual stimuli.
No significant integration was observed following grafting of the same neurons in motor cortex, or transplantation of embryonic motor cortex in visual cortex, indicating that successful transplantation required a match in the areal identity of grafted and lesioned neurons.
These findings demonstrate that transplantation of mouse ESC-derived neurons of appropriate cortical areal identity can contribute to the reconstruction of an adult damaged cortical circuit.'] 

22800282 Human embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic cells maintain core epigenetic machinery of the polycomb group/Trithorax Group complexes distinctly from functional adult hematopoietic stem cells.
['Hematopoietic cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have a number of potential utilities, including the modeling of hematological disorders in vitro, whereas the use for cell replacement therapies has proved to be a loftier goal.
This is due to the failure of differentiated hematopoietic cells, derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), to functionally recapitulate the in vivo properties of bona fide adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).
To better understand the limitations of differentiation programming at the molecular level, we have utilized differential gene expression analysis of highly purified cells that are enriched for hematopoietic repopulating activity across embryonic, fetal, and adult human samples, including in vivo explants of human HSPCs 8-weeks post-transplantation.
We reveal that hESC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (eHPCs) fail to express critical transcription factors which are known to govern self-renewal and myeloid/lymphoid development and instead retain the expression of Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) factors which are more prevalent in embryonic cell types that include EZH1 and ASH1L, respectively.
These molecular profiles indicate that the differential expression of the core epigenetic machinery comprising PcGs/TrxGs in eHPCs may serve as previously unexplored molecular targets that direct hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs toward functional HSPCs in humans.'] 

25421849 Identification of the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in the trajectory of serotonergic differentiation in a rapid assay in mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro.
['The mechanism by which extracellular molecules control serotonergic cell fate remains elusive.
Recently, we showed that noggin, which inactivates bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), induces serotonergic differentiation of mouse embryonic (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cells with coordinated gene expression along the serotonergic lineage.
Here, we created a rapid assay for serotonergic induction by generating knock-in ES cells expressing a naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase driven by the enhancer of Pet-1/Fev, a landmark of serotonergic differentiation.
Using these cells, we performed candidate-based screening and identified BMP type I receptor kinase inhibitors LDN-193189 and DMH1 as activators of luciferase.
LDN-193189 induced ES cells to express the genes encoding Pet-1, tryptophan hydroxylase 2, and the serotonin transporter, and increased serotonin release without altering dopamine release.
In contrast, TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB-431542 selectively inhibited serotonergic differentiation, without changing overall neuronal differentiation.
LDN-193189 inhibited expression of the BMP signaling target gene Id, and induced the TGF-β target gene Lefty, whereas the opposite effect was observed with SB-431542.
This study thus provides a new tool to investigate serotonergic differentiation and suggests that inhibition of BMP type I receptors and concomitant activation of TGF-β receptor signaling are implicated in serotonergic differentiation.
Candidate-based screening for serotonergic induction using a rapid assay in mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor kinase inhibitors selectively induce serotonergic differentiation, whereas the TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB-431542 inhibits the differentiation.
These results suggest that inhibition of BMP type I receptors and concomitant activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor signaling are involved in the early trajectory of serotonergic differentiation.'] 

26170459 Transcriptional activation of human CDCA8 gene regulated by transcription factor NF-Y in embryonic stem cells and cancer cells.
['The cell division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) gene plays an important role in mitosis.
Overexpression of CDCA8 was reported in some human cancers and is required for cancer growth and progression.
We found CDCA8 expression was also high in human ES cells (hESCs) but dropped significantly upon hESC differentiation.
However, the regulation of CDCA8 expression has not yet been studied.
Here, we characterized the CDCA8 promoter and identified its cis-elements and transcription factors.
Three transcription start sites were identified.
Reporter gene assays revealed that the CDCA8 promoter was activated in hESCs and cancer cell lines.
The promoter drove the reporter expression specifically to pluripotent cells during early mouse embryo development and to tumor tissues in tumor-bearing mice.
These results indicate that CDCA8 is transcriptionally activated in hESCs and cancer cells.
Mechanistically, two key activation elements, bound by transcription factor NF-Y and CREB1, respectively, were identified in the CDCA8 basic promoter by mutation analyses and electrophoretic motility shift assays.
NF-Y binding is positively correlated with promoter activities in different cell types.
Interestingly, the NF-YA subunit, binding to the promoter, is primarily a short isoform in hESCs and a long isoform in cancer cells, indicating a different activation mechanism of the CDCA8 transcription between hESCs and cancer cells.
Finally, enhanced CDCA8 promoter activities by NF-Y overexpression and reduced CDCA8 transcription by NF-Y knockdown further verified that NF-Y is a positive regulator of CDCA8 transcription.
Our study unearths the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of CDCA8 expression in hESCs and cancer cells, which provides a better understanding of its biological functions.']

24752503 Aggregate culture of human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes in suspension are an improved in vitro model for drug metabolism and toxicity testing.
['Early phase drug development relies on primary human hepatocytes for studies of drug metabolism, cytotoxicity, and drug-drug interactions.
However, primary human hepatocytes rapidly lose metabolic functions ex vivo and are refractory to expansion in culture and thus are limited in quantity.
Hepatocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (either embryonic stem (ES) or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells), have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of primary human hepatocytes, but to date the use of human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes has been limited by poor enzyme inducibility and immature metabolic function.
Here, we present a simple suspension culture of aggregates of ES cell-derived hepatocytes that compared to conventional monolayer adherent culture significantly increases induction of CYP 1A2 by omeprazole and 3A4 by rifampicin.
Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we further show that ES cell-derived hepatocytes in aggregate culture convert omeprazole and rifampicin to their human-specific metabolites.
We also show that these cells convert acetaminophen (APAP) to its cytotoxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)), although they fail to perform APAP glucuronidation.
In summary, we show that human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes in aggregate culture display improved enzymatic inducibility and metabolic function and is a promising step toward a simple, scalable system, but nonetheless will require further improvements to completely replace primary human hepatocytes in drug development.'] 

22961761 Embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells fuse with microglia and mature neurons.
['Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a novel strategy to restore function in the diseased brain, acting through multiple mechanisms, for example, neuronal replacement, neuroprotection, and modulation of inflammation.
Whether transplanted NSCs can operate by fusing with microglial cells or mature neurons is largely unknown.
Here, we have studied the interaction of a mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem (NS) cell line with rat and mouse microglia and neurons in vitro and in vivo.
We show that NS cells spontaneously fuse with cocultured cortical neurons, and that this process requires the presence of microglia.
Our in vitro data indicate that the NS cells can first fuse with microglia and then with neurons.
The fused NS/microglial cells express markers and retain genetic and functional characteristics of both parental cell types, being able to respond to microglia-specific stimuli (LPS and IL-4/IL-13) and to differentiate to neurons and astrocytes.
The NS cells fuse with microglia, at least partly, through interaction between phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of NS cells and CD36 receptor on microglia.
Transplantation of NS cells into rodent cortex results in fusion with mature pyramidal neurons, which often carry two nuclei, a process probably mediated by microglia.
The fusogenic role of microglia could be even more important after NSC transplantation into brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglia activation.
It remains to be elucidated how the occurrence of the fused cells will influence the functional outcome after NSC transplantation in the diseased brain.'] 

24341592 The reprogramming factor nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 cannot replace octamer-binding transcription factor 4 function in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells.
['Although octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) is one of the most intensively studied factors in mammalian development, no cellular genes capable of replacing Oct-4 function in embryonic stem (ES) cells have been found.
Recent data show that nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (Nr5a2) is able to replace Oct-4 function in the reprogramming process; however, it is unclear whether Nr5a2 can replace Oct-4 function in ES cells.
In this study, the ability of Nr5a2 to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells was investigated.
Nr5a2 localized to the nucleus in ES cells, similarly to Oct-4.
However, expression of Nr5a2 failed to rescue the stem cell phenotype or to maintain the self-renewal ability of ES cells.
Furthermore, as compared with Oct-4-expressing ES cells, Nr5a2-expressing ES cells showed a reduced number of cells in S-phase, did not expand normally, and did not remain in an undifferentiated state.
Ectopic expression of Nr5a2 in ES cells was not able to activate transcription of ES cell-specific genes, and gene expression profiling demonstrated differences between Nr5a2-expressing and Oct-4-expressing ES cells.
In addition, Nr5a2-expressing ES cells were not able to form teratomas in nude mice.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the gene regulation properties of Nr5a2 and Oct-4 and their abilities to confer self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells differ.
The present study provides strong evidence that Nr5a2 cannot replace Oct-4 function in ES cells.']

Signaling via PI3K/FOXO1A pathway modulates formation and survival of human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells.
['Vascular derivatives of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are being developed as sources of tissue-specific cells for organ regeneration.
However, identity of developmental pathways that modulate the specification of endothelial cells is not known yet.
We studied phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Forkhead box O transcription factor 1A (FOXO1A) pathways during differentiation of hESC toward endothelial lineage and on proliferation, maturation, and cell death of hESC-derived endothelial cells (hESC-EC).
During differentiation of hESC, expression of FOXO1A transcription factor was linked to the expression of a cluster of angiogenesis- and vascular remodeling-related genes.
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 activated FOXO1A and induced formation of CD31(+) hESC-EC.
In contrast, differentiating hESC with silenced FOXO1A by small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed lower mRNA levels of CD31 and angiopoietin2.
LY294002 decreased proliferative activity of purified hESC-EC, while FOXO1A siRNA increased their proliferation.
LY294002 inhibits migration and tube formation of hESC-EC; in contrast, FOXO1A siRNA increased in vitro tube formation activity of hESC-EC.
After in vivo conditioning of cells in athymic nude rats, cells retain their low FOXO1A expression levels.
PI3K/FOXO1A pathway is important for function and survival of hESC-EC and in the regulation of endothelial cell fate.

The expression of mesodermal and cardiac transcription factor genes was upregulated in the ginsenoside-treated groups from early stage.
The expression of cardiac sarcomeric genes was significantly upregulated at the late stage.
The gRb1- and gRe-treated groups upregulated the expression of potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1 (KCNE1) and the gRe-treated group showed a longer beating duration compared to the control.

24495215 Identification of nephrotoxic compounds with embryonic stem-cell-derived human renal proximal tubular-like cells.
['The kidney is a major target for drug-induced toxicity, and the renal proximal tubule is frequently affected.
Nephrotoxicity is typically detected only late during drug development, and the nephrotoxic potential of newly approved drugs is often underestimated.
A central problem is the lack of preclinical models with high predictivity.
Validated in vitro models for the prediction of nephrotoxicity are not available.
Major problems are related to the identification of appropriate cell models and end points.
As drug-induced kidney injury is associated with inflammatory reactions, we explored the expression of inflammatory markers as end point for renal in vitro models.
In parallel, we developed a new cell model.
Here, we combined these approaches and developed an in vitro model with embryonic stem-cell-derived human renal proximal tubular-like cells that uses the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 as end points.
The predictivity of the model was evaluated with 41 well-characterized compounds.
The results revealed that the model predicts proximal tubular toxicity in humans with high accuracy.
In contrast, the predictivity was low when well-established standard in vitro assays were used.
Together, the results show that high predictivity can be obtained with in vitro models employing pluripotent stem cell-derived human renal proximal tubular-like cells.']

To study the molecular signature of DFAT cells better, highly purified mature adipocytes were obtained from rats and the purity was more than 98%, and about 98.6% were monocytes.
These mature adipocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells spontaneously by the ceiling culture method, these cells proliferated rapidly in vitro, grew in the same direction and formed vertex, and expressed extensively embryonic stem cell markers such as Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Nanog, surface antigen SSEA-1, CD105, and CD31, moreover, these cells possessed ALP and telomerase activity.

24677652 Erythropoiesis from human embryonic stem cells through erythropoietin-independent AKT signaling.
['Unlimited self renewal capacity and differentiation potential make human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) a promising source for the ex vivo manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) for safe transfusion.
Current methods to induce erythropoiesis from PSC suffer from low yields of RBCs, most of which are immature and contain embryonic and fetal rather than adult hemoglobins.
We have previously shown that homodimerization of the intracellular component of MPL (ic-MPL) induces erythropoiesis from human cord blood progenitors.
The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of ic-MPL dimerization to induce erythropoiesis from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and to identify the signaling pathways activated by this strategy.
We present here the evidence that ic-MPL dimerization induces erythropoietin (EPO)-independent erythroid differentiation from hESC by inducing the generation of erythroid progenitors and by promoting more efficient erythroid maturation with increased RBC enucleation as well as increased gamma:epsilon globin ratio and production of beta-globin protein.
ic-MPL dimerization is significantly more potent than EPO in inducing erythropoiesis, and its effect is additive to EPO.
Signaling studies show that dimerization of ic-MPL, unlike stimulation of the wild type MPL receptor, activates AKT in the absence of JAK2/STAT5 signaling.
AKT activation upregulates GATA-1 and FOXO3 transcriptional pathways with resulting inhibition of apoptosis, modulation of cell cycle, and enhanced maturation of erythroid cells.
These findings open up potential new targets for the generation of therapeutically relevant RBC products from hPSC.']

24627557 Induced overexpression of OCT4A in human embryonic stem cells increases cloning efficiency.
['Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal and differentiation is incomplete.
The level of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), a critical regulator of pluripotency, is precisely controlled in mouse embryonic stem cells.
However, studies of human OCT4 are often confounded by the presence of three isoforms and six expressed pseudogenes, which has complicated the interpretation of results.
Using an inducible lentiviral overexpression and knockdown system to manipulate OCT4A above or below physiological levels, we specifically examine the functional role of the OCT4A isoform in hESC. (We also designed and generated a comparable series of vectors, which were not functional, for the overexpression and knockdown of OCT4B.) We show that specific knockdown of OCT4A results in hESC differentiation, as indicated by morphology changes, cell surface antigen expression, and upregulation of ectodermal genes.
In contrast, inducible overexpression of OCT4A in hESC leads to a transient instability of the hESC phenotype, as indicated by changes in morphology, cell surface antigen expression, and transcriptional profile, that returns to baseline within 5 days.
Interestingly, sustained expression of OCT4A past 5 days enhances hESC cloning efficiency, suggesting that higher levels of OCT4A can support self-renewal.
Overall, our results indicate that high levels of OCT4A increase hESC cloning efficiency and do not induce differentiation (whereas OCT4B expression cannot be induced in hESC), highlighting the importance of isoform-specific studies in a stable and inducible expression system for human OCT4.
Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of an efficient method for conditional gene expression in hESC.'] 

24158103 The ROCK inhibitor Y-26732 enhances the survival and proliferation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells upon dissociation.
['Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are the starting material required for neuronal subtype differentiation.
Proliferation of hNPCs allows researchers to study the mechanistic complexities and microenvironments present during neural differentiation and to explore potential applications for hNPCs in cell therapies.
The use of enzymatic dissociation during hNPC proliferation causes dissociation-induced apoptosis; therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of the p-160-Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-26732 on dissociation-induced apoptosis of hNPCs.
We generated hNPCs via embryoid body formation using serum-free culture medium supplemented with noggin.
The established hNPCs were characterized and the effect of the ROCK inhibitor on hNPC dissociation was studied.
We demonstrated that supplementation of the culture media with 10 μM Y-26732 efficiently reduced apoptosis of dissociated hNPCs; this supplementation was effective when the inhibitor was applied either at (i)
24 h before dissociation of the cells and at 24 h after plating the cells or (ii) at 24 h after plating of the cells only.
In addition to reducing apoptosis, both supplementation conditions with Y-26732 enhanced the proliferation of dissociated hNPCs.
Our findings provide the optimal time window for ROCK treatment of hNPC dissociation in respect to apoptosis and cell proliferation.'] 

26586818 Functional Deficiencies in Fragile X Neurons Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
[StringElement('Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited mental retardation, is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which in FXS becomes inactivated during human embryonic development.
We have shown recently that this process is recapitulated by in vitro neural differentiation of FX human embryonic stem cells (FX-hESCs), derived from FXS blastocysts.
In the present study, we analyzed morphological and functional properties of neurons generated from FX-hESCs.
Human FX neurons can fire single action potentials (APs) to depolarizing current commands, but are unable to discharge trains of APs.
Their APs are of a reduced amplitudes and longer durations than controls.
These are reflected in reduced inward Na(+) and outward K(+) currents.
In addition, human FX neurons contain fewer synaptic vesicles and lack spontaneous synaptic activity.
Notably, synaptic activity in these neurons can be restored by coculturing them with normal rat hippocampal neurons, demonstrating a critical role for synaptic mechanisms in FXS pathology.

26133243 Comparative Analysis of Whole-Genome
Gene Expression Changes in Cultured Human Embryonic Stem Cells in Response to Low, Clinical Diagnostic Relevant, and High Doses of Ionizing Radiation Exposure.
['The biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) exposure in humans are not comprehensively understood, generating a high degree of controversy in published literature.
The earliest stages of human development are known to be among the most sensitive to stress exposures, especially genotoxic stresses.
However, the risks stemming from exposure to LDIR, particularly within the clinical diagnostic relevant dose range, have not been directly evaluated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
Here, we describe the dynamics of the whole genome transcriptional responses of different hESC lines to both LDIR and, as a reference, high-dose IR (HDIR).
We found that even doses as low as 0.05 Gy could trigger statistically significant transient changes in a rather limited subset of genes in all hESCs lines examined.
Gene expression signatures of hESCs exposed to IR appear to be highly dose-, time-, and cell line-dependent.
We identified 50 genes constituting consensus gene expression signature as an early response to HDIR across all lines of hESC examined.
We observed substantial differences in biological pathways affected by either LDIR or HDIR in hESCs, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms underpinning the responses of hESC may fundamentally differ depending on radiation doses.'] 

25145356 Blocking autocrine VEGF signaling by sunitinib, an anti-cancer drug, promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming.
['Maintaining the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could be achieved by activating the extrinsic signaling, i.e., the use of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or blocking the intrinsic differentiation pathways, i.e., the use of GSK3 and MEK inhibitors (2i).
Here we found that even in medium supplemented with LIF, mESCs still tend to differentiate toward meso-endoderm lineages after long-term culture and the culture spontaneously secretes vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs).
Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib, an anti-cancer drug and a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor mainly targeting VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), is capable of maintaining the mESCs in the undifferentiated state without the need for feeder cells or LIF. Sunitinib facilitates the derivation of mESCs from blastocysts, and the mESCs maintained in sunitinib-containing medium remain pluripotent and are able to contribute to chimeric mice.
Sunitinib also promotes iPSC generation from MEFs with only Oct4.
Knocking down VEGFR2 or blocking it with neutralizing antibody mimicks the effect of sunitinib, indicating that blocking VEGF/VEGFR signaling is indeed beneficial to the self-renewal of mESCs.
We also found that hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1α) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are involved in the production of VEGF in mESCs.
Blocking both pathways inhibits the expression of VEGF and prevents spontaneous differentiation of mESCs.
Interestingly, LIF may also exert its effect by downregulating HIF1α and ER stress pathways and subsequent VEGF expression.
These results indicate the existence of an intrinsic differentiation pathway in mESCs by activating the autocrine VEGF signaling.
Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib or other small molecules help to maintain the mESCs in the ground state of pluripotency.'] 

23212373 The RB family is required for the self-renewal and survival of human embryonic stem cells.
['The mechanisms ensuring the long-term self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells are still only partly understood, limiting their use in cellular therapies.
Here we found that increased activity of the RB cell cycle inhibitor in human embryonic stem cells induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation and cell death.
Conversely, inactivation of the entire RB family (RB, p107 and p130) in human embryonic stem cells triggers G2/M arrest and cell death through functional activation of the p53 pathway and the cell cycle inhibitor p21.
Differences in E2F target gene activation upon loss of RB family function between human embryonic stem cells, mouse embryonic stem cells and human fibroblasts underscore key differences in the cell cycle regulatory networks of human embryonic stem cells.
Finally, loss of RB family function promotes genomic instability in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells, uncoupling cell cycle defects from chromosomal instability.
These experiments indicate that a homeostatic level of RB activity is essential for the self-renewal and the survival of human embryonic stem cells.']

25168892 Induced expression of Fndc5 significantly increased cardiomyocyte differentiation rate of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 protein (Fndc5) is an exercise hormone and its transcript profile in mouse showed high degree of expression in heart, skeletal muscle and brain.
Our previous studies indicated a significant increase (approximately 10 fold) in mRNA level of Fndc5 when embryonic stem cells were differentiated into beating bodies.
As a step closer to identify the involvement of Fndc5 in the process of cardiomyocyte differentiation, we generated a stably inducible transduced mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line that overexpressed Fndc5 following Doxycycline induction.
Our results indicated that the overexpression of Fndc5 during spontaneous cardiac differentiation significantly increased not only at RNA levels for mesodermal markers but also at the transcriptional levels for cardiac progenitor and cardiac genes.
These data suggest that Fndc5 may be involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation.
Therefore, a new hope will be arisen for potential application of this myokine for regeneration of damaged cardiac tissues especially in cardiac failure.'] 

25569105 A tight control of Rif1 by Oct4 and Smad3 is critical for mouse embryonic stem cell stability.
['Prolonged culture of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) leads them to adopt embryonal carcinoma cell features, creating enormous dangers for their further application.
The mechanism involved in ESC stability has not, however, been extensively studied.
We previously reported that SMAD family member 3 (Smad3) has an important role in maintaining mouse ESC stability, as depletion of Smad3 results in cancer cell-like properties in ESCs and Smad3-/- ESCs are prone to grow large, malignant teratomas.
To understand how Smad3 contributes to ESC stability, we performed microarray analysis to compare the transcriptome of wild-type and Smad3-/- ESCs.
We found that Rif1 (RAP1-associated protein 1), a factor important for genomic stability, is significantly upregulated in Smad3-/- ESCs.
The expression level of Rif1 needs to be tightly controlled in ESCs, as a low level of Rif1 is associated with ESC differentiation, but a high level of Rif1 is linked to ESC transformation.
In ESCs, Oct4 activates Rif1, whereas Smad3 represses its expression.
Oct4 recruits Smad3 to bind to Rif1 promoter, but Smad3 joining facilitates the loading of a polycomb complex that generates a repressive epigenetic modification on Rif1 promoter, and thus maintains the expression of Rif1 at a proper level in ESCs.
Interestingly, Rif1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transduced Smad3-/- ESCs showed less malignant properties than the control shRNA-transduced Smad3-/- ESCs, suggesting a critical role of Rif1 in maintaining the stability of ESCs during proliferation.']

Exploiting the power of LINE-1 retrotransposon mutagenesis for identification of genes involved in embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Identifying the genes or epigenetic factors that control the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells is critical to understanding the molecular basis of cell commitment.
Although a number of insertional mutagenesis vectors have been developed for identifying gene functions in animal models, the L1 retrotransposition system offers additional advantages as a tool to disrupt genes in embryonic stem cells in order to identify their functions and the phenotypes associated with them.
Recent advances in producing synthetic versions of L1 retrotransposon vector system and the optimization of techniques to accurately identify retrotransposon integration sites have increased their utility for gene discovery applications.
We have developed a novel episomal, nonviral L1 retrotransposon vector using scaffold/matrix attachment regions that provides stable, sustained levels of retrotransposition in cell cultures without being affected by epigenetic silencing or from some of the common problems of vector integration.
This modified vector contains a GFP marker whose expression occurs only after successful gene disruption events and thus the cells with disrupted genes can be easily picked for functional analysis.
Here we present a method to disrupt gene function in embryonic stem cells that aid in the identification of genes involved in stem cell differentiation processes.
The methods presented here can be easily adapted to the study of other types of cancer stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells using the L1 retrotransposon as an insertional mutagen.'] 

23863483 MRAS GTPase is a novel stemness marker that impacts mouse embryonic stem cell plasticity and Xenopus embryonic cell fate.
['Pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), maintained in the presence of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine, provide a powerful model with which to study pluripotency and differentiation programs.
Extensive microarray studies on cultured cells have led to the identification of three LIF signatures.
Here we focus on muscle ras oncogene homolog (MRAS), which is a small GTPase of the Ras family encoded within the Pluri gene cluster.
To characterise the effects of Mras on cell pluripotency and differentiation, we used gain- and loss-of-function strategies in mESCs and in the Xenopus laevis embryo, in which Mras gene structure and protein sequence are conserved.
We show that persistent knockdown of Mras in mESCs reduces expression of specific master genes and that MRAS plays a crucial role in the downregulation of OCT4 and NANOG protein levels upon differentiation.
In Xenopus, we demonstrate the potential of Mras to modulate cell fate at early steps of development and during neurogenesis.
Overexpression of Mras allows gastrula cells to retain responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin.
Collectively, these results highlight novel conserved and pleiotropic effects of MRAS in stem cells and early steps of development.'] 

23086797 Hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells on growth factor-containing surfaces.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hold considerable promise in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as a source of tissue-specific cells.
Hepatocytes derived from ESCs will be useful for therapies, bioartificial liver assistance devices and drug discovery.
In traditional stem cell cultivation/differentiation experiments, growth factors (GFs) are added in soluble form in order to provide signals for tissue-specific differentiation.
In contrast, we investigated differentiation of hESCs cultured on top of GFs.
In these experiments, glass substrates were imprinted with a mixture of ECM and GF molecules to form 500\u2009µm diameter spots.
hESCs were cultured onto these GF-containing ECM spots for up to 12\u2009days to induce differentiation towards the hepatic lineage.
The dynamics of differentiation were examined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry.
Stem cells cultured on GF-containing surfaces stained positive for the endoderm markers SOX17 and FOXA2, as well as early liver markers such as α-fetoprotein and albumin.
qRT-PCR confirmed that pluripotency, endoderm and liver gene expression of hESCs cultured on GF-containing surfaces was consistent with hepatic differentiation.
In comparison, hESCs cultured on ECM spots without GFs showed less pronounced loss of pluripotency and lower levels of liver gene expression.
In summary, our study demonstrates that hESCs receive differentiation-inducing signals from GF-containing surfaces and may be pushed along the hepatic lineage when cultured on such surfaces.
Compared to traditional approaches, the advantages of GF immobilization include reduction in the cost of experiments, stronger and longer stimulation and the possibility of screening GF-stem cell interactions in a multiplexed manner.']

The DNT-EST: a predictive embryonic stem cell-based assay for developmental neurotoxicity testing in vitro.
['As the developing brain is exquisitely vulnerable to chemical disturbances, testing for developmental neurotoxicity of a substance is an important aspect of characterizing its tissue specific toxicity.
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can be differentiated toward a neural phenotype, and this can be used as a model for early brain development.
We developed a new in vitro assay using mESCs to predict adverse effects of chemicals and other compounds on neural development - the so-called DNT-EST.
After treatment of differentiating stem cells for 48h or 72h, at two key developmental stages endpoint for neural differentiation, viability, and proliferation were assessed.
As a reference, we similarly treated undifferentiated stem cells 2 days after plating for 48h or 72h in parallel to the differentiating stem cells.
Here, we show that chemical testing of a training set comprising nine substances (six substances of known developmental toxicity and three without specific developmental neurotoxicity) enabled a mathematical prediction model to be formulated that provided 100% predictivity and accuracy for the given substances, including in leave-one-out cross-validation.
The described test method can be performed within two weeks, including data analysis, and provides a prediction of the developmental neurotoxicity potency of a substance.'] 

24818841 Cardiogenesis of embryonic stem cells with liquid marble micro-bioreactor.
['A liquid marble micro-bioreactor is prepared by placing a drop of murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) (Oct4B2-ESC) suspension onto a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particle bed.
The Oct4B2-ESC aggregates to form embryoid bodies (EBs) with relatively uniform size and shape in a liquid marble within 3 d. For the first time, the feasibility of differentiating ESC into cardiac lineages within liquid marbles is being investigated.
Without the addition of growth factors, suspended EBs from liquid marbles express various precardiac mesoderm markers including Flk-1, Gata4, and Nkx2.5.
Some of the suspended EBs exhibit spontaneous contraction.
These results indicate that the liquid marble provides a suitable microenvironment to induce EB formation and spontaneous cardiac mesoderm differentiation.
Some of the EBs are subsequently plated onto gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes.
Plated EBs express mature cardiac markers atrial myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a) and ventricular myosin light chain (MLC2v), and the cardiac structural marker α-actinin.
More than 60% of the plated EBs exhibit spontaneous contraction and express mature cardiomyocyte marker cardiac troponin T (cTnT), indicating that these EBs have differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes.
Together, these results demonstrate that the liquid-marble technique is an easily employed, cost effective, and efficient approach to generate EBs and facilitating their cardiogenesis.'] 

23580657 Differential role for transcription factor Oct4 nucleocytoplasmic dynamics in somatic cell reprogramming and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells.
['Oct4 is a member of the POU family of transcription factors and plays a critical role in both maintenance of the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem (ES) cells and in the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells.
Oct4 is imported into the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor; however, the spatiotemporal dynamic behavior of Oct4 remains largely unknown.
In the present study we show that Oct4 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.
Furthermore, although Oct4 mutants with altered nuclear import/export activity were able to maintain the self-renewal of ES cells, they displayed limited potential for cellular reprogramming.
These results indicate that the intracellular localization of Oct4, which is dependent on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, must be more strictly regulated for cellular reprogramming, suggesting that Oct4 plays differential roles in the self-renewal of ES cells and in somatic cell reprogramming.'] 

21685889 Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 alleviates Tcf3 repression of the pluripotency network and increases embryonic stem cell resistance to differentiation.
['Self-renewal of rodent embryonic stem cells is enhanced by partial inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3; refs 1, 2).
This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by β-catenin, stabilization of Myc protein and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes.
Here we demonstrate that β-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition.
Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated β-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain.
However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with β-catenin.
Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells.
Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that β-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function.
We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network.'] 

23051821 Functions of BMP signaling in embryonic stem cell fate determination.
['Embryonic stem (ES) cells, which can self-renew and can differentiate to various cell types, have great potential applications in regenerative medicine.
BMP family members are evolutionarily conserved factors that play critical roles in embryogenesis and in adult tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms, and their malfunction can lead to various human diseases.
Consistent with its importance in early embryogenesis, BMP signaling has been established as a key determinant that directs a wide range of cell fate choices in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells, from self-renewal maintenance to multiple differentiation processes.
Remarkably, BMPs exert their diverse functions via integrating with signal inputs from other extrinsic signals and intrinsic factors, including transcription factors and epigenetic regulators.
Here we summarize the current understanding of BMP signaling in embryonic stem cell fate determination, and discuss the delicate cooperation between BMP signaling and its partners in these processes.
The principles learned from these studies would pave a road for the potential medical applications of embryonic stem cells.']

The cells have unlimited proliferation potential and capacity to differentiate into the cells of the three germ layers.
Human embryonic stem cells are used to study human embryogenesis and disease modeling and may in the future serve as cells for cell therapy and drug screening.
Human embryonic stem cells are usually isolated from surplus normal frozen embryos and were suggested to be isolated from diseased embryos detected by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.
Here we report the isolation of 12 human embryonic stem cell lines and their thorough characterization.
The lines were derived from embryos detected to have aneuploidy by pre-implantation genetic screening.
Karyotype analysis of these cell lines showed that they are euploid, having 46 chromosomes.
Our interpretation is that the euploid cells originated from mosaic embryos, and in vitro selection favored the euploid cells.
The undifferentiated cells exhibited long-term proliferation and expressed markers typical for embryonic stem cells such as OCT4, NANOG, and TRA-1-60.
The cells manifested pluripotent differentiation both in vivo and in vitro.
To further characterize the different lines, we have analyzed their ethnic origin and the family relatedness among them.
The above results led us to conclude that the aneuploid mosaic embryos that are destined to be discarded can serve as source for normal euploid human embryonic stem cell lines.
These lines represent various ethnic groups; more lines are needed to represent all populations.']

A Simple and Efficient Method of Slow Freezing for Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.

A good understanding of the complicated cardiomyocyte differentiation process benefits cardiogenesis study.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), cell lines with infinite ability to proliferate and to be differentiated into all cell types of the adult body, are important research tools for investigation of differentiation and meanwhile good models for developmental research.
In the current study, genome-wide gene expression of ESCs is profiled through high throughput platform during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation and maturation.
Gene expression patterns of undifferentiated ESCs and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes provide a global overview of genes involved in cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation, whereas marker gene expression profiles of both ESC-related genes and cardiac-specific genes presented the expression pattern shift during differentiation in a pure ESC-derived cardiomyocyte cell culture system.

26877219 Morphine sulfate concomitantly decreases neuronal differentiation and opioid receptor expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Opioids have been shown to affect prenatal and postnatal neural development in mammals.
The present study investigates the impact of morphine sulfate (MS) treatment on neuronal differentiation as well as μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells.
Stem cells were manipulated in culture to differentiate in 3 sequential stages: Stage 1, cell transformation to embryoid bodies (EB); Stage 2, EB cell differentiation to neural progenitor (NP) cells; and, Stage 3, NP cell differentiation to neurons/astrocytes co-cultured cells.
Using RT-PCR and flow cytometry analyses, cell types were confirmed by monitoring expression of Oct4, nestin, microtubule-associated protein 2 (mtap-2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as cell-specific markers for stem cells, NP cells, neurons, and astrocytes, respectively.
Similarly, gene expression for MOR, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and δ-opioid receptor (DOR) was confirmed in each cell type.
In order to investigate the effects of MS on differentiation, cells were treated with MS (1, 10, 100 μM) at either early (Stage 1) or late (Stage 3) stage of cellular differentiation.
At Stage 1 exposure, MOR gene expression and neuroectoderm specific marker expression of nestin were down-regulated in both EB and NP cells.
In addition, the opioid down-regulated GFAP in differentiated neurons/astrocytes co-cultured cells.
Late stage treatment with MS resulted in a down-regulation of mtap-2 and GFAP in differentiated neurons/astrocytes co-cultured cells.
Moreover, late stage treatment with MS and naltrexone inhibited the effect of MS on neuronal differentiation, suggesting that MS treatment interferes with differentiation via MOR activation.
Together, the results show that MS exposure at early and late stage of cellular differentiation significantly decreases genotype and phenotype in differentiated neuronal cells.
The results of this study have implications regarding the potential effect of opiates on fetal brain development.'] 

27273982 [Expert consensus on induction of human embryonic stem cells into tenocytes].
['Embryonic stem cells have unlimited proliferative capacity, which may provide a source of tendon stem/progenitor cells for tissue engineering.
Experts of International Science and Technology Collaborative Program of Ministry of Science and Technology have developed a protocol consensus on differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into the tendon cells.
The consensus recommends a protocol of two-step generation of human embryonic stem cells into tendon cells: the human embryonic stem cells are first differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells on different material surfaces; then with the scaffold-free tissue engineering tendon formed by high-density planting, the mesenchymal stem cells are induced into tendon cells under static or dynamic mechanical stimulation in vivo and in vitro.
Tissue engineering tendon established in vitro by the protocol can be used as a model in toxicological analysis and safety evaluation of tendon-relevant small molecule compounds, medical materials and drugs.'] 

26819254 A Simple Method for Labeling Human Embryonic Stem Cells Destined to Lose Undifferentiated Potency.
['Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a major source of cellular ATP. Its usage as an energy source varies, not only according to the extracellular environment, but also during development and differentiation, as indicated by the reported changes in the flux ratio of glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation.
The fluorescent probe JC-1 allows visualization of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential produced by oxidative phosphorylation.
Strong JC-1 signals were localized in the differentiated cells located at the edge of H9 ES colonies that expressed vimentin, an early differentiation maker.
The JC-1 signals were further intensified when individual adjacent colonies were in contact with each other.
Time-lapse analyses revealed that JC-1-labeled H9 cells under an overconfluent condition were highly differentiated after subculture, suggesting that monitoring oxidative phosphorylation in live cells might facilitate the prediction of induced pluripotent stem cells, as well as ES cells, that are destined to lose their undifferentiated potency.'] 

23765957 Phenotypic correction and stable expression of factor VIII in hemophilia A mice by embryonic stem cell therapy.
['Hereditary deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII) leads to hemophilia A, a severe X-linked bleeding disorder.
Current therapies include fixed-dose FVIII prophylaxis, factor replacement therapy, and most recently, gene therapy.
Prophylaxis and FVIII replacement therapies are limited by incomplete efficacy, high cost, restricted availability, and development of neutralizing antibodies in chronically treated individuals.
Limited success has been obtained in preclinical trials using gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia.
Therefore, new options for therapy for hemophilia A are needed.
We evaluated the potential of embryonic stem cells for correcting hemophilia A in mice.
FVIII-deficient mouse blastocysts were collected and injected with mouse embryonic stem cells stably expressing green-fluorescent protein (GFP) and transferred to pseudopregnant recipient mice.
Expression of FVIII was measured in the liver and plasma of the 5 chimeric mice that were produced.
Three of these mice were GFP-positive at the age of 6 months.
The plasma FVIII activity levels were equal to those of wild-type mice.
These data demonstrate that embryonic stem cell transplantation at an early embryonic stage has potential as therapy for this progressively debilitating, life-threatening bleeding disorder.'] 

26389663 Network plasticity of pluripotency transcription factors in embryonic stem cells.
['Transcription factor (TF) networks are thought to regulate embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency.
However, TF expression dynamics and regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood.
We use reporter mouse ESC lines allowing non-invasive quantification of Nanog or Oct4 protein levels and continuous long-term single-cell tracking and quantification over many generations to reveal diverse TF protein expression dynamics.
For cells with low Nanog expression, we identified two distinct colony types: one re-expressed Nanog in a mosaic pattern, and the other did not re-express Nanog over many generations.
Although both expressed pluripotency markers, they exhibited differences in their TF protein correlation networks and differentiation propensities.
Sister cell analysis revealed that differences in Nanog levels are not necessarily accompanied by differences in the expression of other pluripotency factors.
Thus, regulatory interactions of pluripotency TFs are less stringently implemented in individual self-renewing ESCs than assumed at present.'] 

25097004 Regeneration of uterine horns in rats using collagen scaffolds loaded with human embryonic stem cell-derived endometrium-like cells.
['A variety of diseases may lead to hysterectomies or uterine injuries, which may form a scar and lead to infertility.
Due to the limitation of native materials, there are a few effective methods to treat such damages.
Tissue engineering combines cell and molecular biology with materials and mechanical engineering to replace or repair damaged organs and tissues.
The use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a donor cell source for the replacement therapy will require the development of simple and reliable cell differentiation protocols.
This study aimed at efficiently generating endometrium-like cells from the hESCs and at using these cells with collagen scaffold to repair uterine damage.
The hESCs were induced by co-culturing with endometrial stromal cells, and simultaneously added cytokines: epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor-b (PDGF-b), and E2.
Expression of cell specific markers was analyzed by immunofluorescence and reverse trascription-polymerase chain reaction to monitor the progression toward an endometrium-like cell fate.
After differentiation, the majority of cells (>80%) were positive for cytokeratin-7, and the expression of key transcription factors related to endometrial development, such as Wnt4, Wnt7a, Wnt5a, Hoxa11, and factors associated with endometrial epithelial cell function: Hoxa10, Intergrinβ3, LIF, ER, and PR were also detected.
Then, we established the uterine full-thickness-injury rat models to test cell function in vivo.
hESC-derived cells were dropped onto collagen scaffolds and transplanted into the animal model.
Twelve weeks after transplantation, we discovered that the hESC-derived cells could survive and recover the structure and function of uterine horns in a rat model of severe uterine damage.
The experimental system presented here provides a reliable protocol to produce endometrium-like cells from hESCs.
Our results encourage the use of hESCs in cell-replacement therapy for severe uterine damage in future.'] 

26266544 Differentiate or Die: 3-Bromopyruvate and Pluripotency in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.

['Embryonic stem (ES) cells secrete some soluble factors which may affect the differentiation potential of adult stem cells toward different lineages.
In the present study, we evaluated neural differentiation of mouse adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) following coculture with ES cells.
For this purpose, ADSCs were induced in a medium supplemented with a synthetic serum replacement and various concentrations of retinoic acid (RA).
Then, third-passaged ADSCs were indirectly cocultured with ES cells, and the expression levels of pluripotency markers, OCT4 and Sox2, mesenchymal stem cell markers, CD73 and CD105, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were assessed in the cocultured ADSCs.
Moreover, the control and cocultured ADSCs were differentiated with or without RA treatment.
We showed here that 2-week differentiated ADSCs expressed several neuron-specific genes, and RA treatment improved neural differentiation of the ADSCs.
The expression levels of OCT4, Sox2 and PCNA were upregulated in the cocultured ADSCs.
Moreover, coculture with the ES cells significantly improved neural differentiation of the ADSCs.
Treatment of the cocultured ADSCs with RA diminished the expression of neural maturation markers.
Coculture with the ES cells efficiently improves neural differentiation of the ADSCs.
Non-contact coculture with the ES cells may be used as an efficient strategy to improve differentiation potential of adult stem cells for developmental studies and regenerative medicine.'] 

22438181 Culture conditions for bovine embryonic stem cell-like cells isolated from blastocysts after external fertilization.
['Although isolation and characterization of embryonic stem cells have been successful in cattle, maintenance of bovine embryonic stem cells in culture remains difficult.
In this study, we compared different methods of cell passaging, feeder cell layers and medium conditions for bovine embryonic stem cell-like cells.
We found that a murine embryonic fibroblast feeder layer is more suitable for embryonic stem cell-like cells than bovine embryonic fibroblasts.
When murine embryonic fibroblasts were used, a mechanical method of passaging led to better cell growth than passaging by trypsin digestion.
We also found that exogenous supplementation with leukemia inhibitory factor maintained the embryonic stem cell-like cells in an undifferentiated state, whereas addition of stem cell factor resulted in their differentiation.

23936178 Effect of antibiotics against Mycoplasma sp. on human embryonic stem cells undifferentiated status, pluripotency, cell viability and growth.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing pluripotent cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and hold great promise as models for human development and disease studies, cell-replacement therapies, drug discovery and in vitro cytotoxicity tests.
The culture and differentiation of these cells are both complex and expensive, so it is essential to extreme aseptic conditions.
hESCs are susceptible to Mycoplasma sp.
infection, which is hard to detect and alters stem cell-associated properties.
The purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and cytotoxic effect of Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin (specific antibiotics used for Mycoplasma sp.
eradication) on hESCs.
Mycoplasma sp.
infected HUES-5 884 (H5 884, stable hESCs H5-brachyury promoter-GFP line) cells were effectively cured with a 14 days Plasmocin(TM)
25 µg/ml treatment (curative treatment) while maintaining stemness characteristic features.
Furthermore, cured H5 884 cells exhibit the same karyotype as the parental H5 line and expressed GFP, through up-regulation of brachyury promoter, at day 4 of differentiation onset.
Moreover, H5 cells treated with ciprofloxacin 10 µg/ml for 14 days (mimic of curative treatment) and H5 and WA09 (H9)
hESCs treated with Plasmocin(TM)
5 µg/ml (prophylactic treatment) for 5 passages retained hESCs features, as judged by the expression of stemness-related genes (TRA1-60, TRA1-81, SSEA-4, Oct-4, Nanog) at mRNA and protein levels.
In addition, the presence of specific markers of the three germ layers (brachyury, Nkx2.5 and cTnT: mesoderm; AFP: endoderm; nestin and Pax-6: ectoderm) was verified in in vitro differentiated antibiotic-treated hESCs.
In conclusion, we found that Plasmocin(TM) and ciprofloxacin do not affect hESCs stemness and pluripotency nor cell viability.
However, curative treatments slightly diminished cell growth rate.
This cytotoxic effect was reversible as cells regained normal growth rate upon antibiotic withdrawal.'] 

23294113 Plasticity of calcium signaling cascades in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors.
["Human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors (hESC NPs) are considered to be a promising tool for cell-based therapy in central nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.
The Ca(2+) ion is an important intracellular messenger essential for the regulation of various cellular functions.
We investigated the role and physiology of Ca(2+) signaling to characterize the functional properties of CCTL14 hESC NPs during long-term maintenance in culture (in vitro).
We analyzed changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) evoked by high K(+), adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and caffeine in correlation with the expression of various neuronal markers in different passages (P6 through P10) during the course of hESC differentiation.
We found that only differentiated NPs from P7 exhibited significant and specific [Ca(2+)]i responses to various stimuli.
About 31% of neuronal-like P7 NPs exhibited spontaneous [Ca(2+)]i oscillations.
Pharmacological and immunocytochemical assays revealed that P7 NPs express L- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, P2X2, P2X3, P2X7, and P2Y purinoreceptors, glutamate receptors, and ryanodine (RyR1 and RyR3) receptors.
The ATP- and glutamate-induced [Ca(2+)]i responses were concentration-dependent.
Higher glutamate concentrations (over 100\u2009μM) caused cell death.
Responses to ATP were observed in the presence or in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+).
These results emphasize the notion that with time in culture, these cells attain a transient period of operative Ca(2+) signaling that is predictive of their ability to act as stem elements."]

[StringElement("Diabetes is one of the main causes of death in the world.
Diabetes is marked by high blood glucose levels and develops when the body doesn't produce enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.

25519907 Dual roles of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation in human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and neural differentiation.
['Early neurodevelopment requires cell fate commitment from pluripotent stem cells to restricted neural lineages, which involves the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and lineage-specific gene transcription.
However, it remains unclear how histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), an epigenetic mark representing transcriptionally active chromatin, is involved in the neural commitment from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
In this study, we demonstrate that H3K9Ac gradually declines during the first 4 days of in vitro neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and then increases during days 4-8.
Consistent with this finding, the H3K9Ac enrichment at several pluripotency genes was decreased, and H3K9Ac occupancies at the loci of neurodevelopmental genes increased during hESC neural commitment.
Inhibiting H3K9 deacetylation on days 0-4 by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) promoted hESC pluripotency and suppressed its neural differentiation.
Conversely, HDACi-elicited up-regulation of H3K9 acetylation on days 4-8 enhanced neural differentiation and activated multiple neurodevelopmental genes.
Mechanistically, HDACis promote pluripotency gene transcription to support hESC self-renewal through suppressing HDAC3 activity.
During hESC neural commitment, HDACis relieve the inhibitory activities of HDAC1/5/8 and thereby promote early neurodevelopmental gene expression by interfering with gene-specific histone acetylation patterns.
Furthermore, p300 is primarily identified as the major histone acetyltransferase involved in both hESC pluripotency and neural differentiation.
Our results indicate that epigenetic modification plays pivotal roles during the early neural specification of hESCs.
The histone acetylation, which is regulated by distinct HDAC members at different neurodevelopmental stages, plays dual roles in hESC pluripotency maintenance and neural differentiation.']

24316986 Pluripotency factors and Polycomb Group proteins repress aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression in murine embryonic stem cells.
['The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor and environmental sensor that regulates expression of genes involved in drug-metabolism and cell cycle regulation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Ahr ablation in mice and studies with orthologous genes in invertebrates suggest that AHR may also play a significant role in embryonic development.
To address this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Ahr expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny.
In ES cells, interactions between OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2 and Polycomb Group proteins at the Ahr promoter repress AHR expression, which can also be repressed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors in hepatoma cells.
In ES cells, unproductive RNA polymerase II binds at the Ahr transcription start site and drives the synthesis of short abortive transcripts.
Activation of Ahr expression during differentiation follows from reversal of repressive marks in Ahr promoter chromatin, release of pluripotency factors and PcG proteins, binding of Sp factors, establishment of histone marks of open chromatin, and engagement of active RNAPII to drive full-length RNA transcript elongation.
Our results suggest that reversible Ahr repression in ES cells holds the gene poised for expression and allows for a quick switch to activation during embryonic development.']

['Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have great clinical potential in modulating inflammation and promoting tissue repair.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have recently emerged as a potentially superior cell source for MSCs.

We term these cells "T-MSCs" and show that T-MSCs express a phenotype and differentiation potential minimally required to define MSCs.
T-MSCs exhibit potent immunomodulatory activity in vitro as they can remarkably inhibit proliferation of cocultured T and B lymphocytes.
Unlike bone marrow MSCs, T-MSCs do not have increased expression of inflammatory mediators in response to IFNγ.
Moreover, T-MSCs constitutively express a high level of the immune inhibitory ligand PD-L1 and elicit strong and durable efficacy in two distinct animal models of autoimmune disease, dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, at doses near those approved for clinical trials.
Together, we present a simple and fast derivation method to generate MSCs from hESCs, which possess potent immunomodulatory properties in vitro and in vivo and may serve as a novel and ideal candidate for MSC-based therapies.']

Recent reports have shown molecular ties between the cell cycle and the differentiation mechanism of embryonic stem (ES) cells, assuming that cell fate decisions are controlled by the cell cycle machinery.
Both β cells and ES cells possess unique cell cycle machinery yet with significant contrasts.
In this review, we compare the cell cycle control mechanisms in both ES cells and β cells, and highlight the fundamental differences between pluripotent cells of embryonic origin and differentiated β cells.
Through critical analysis of the differences of the cell cycle between these two cell types, we propose that the cell cycle of ES cells may act as a brake for β-cell regeneration.
Based on these differences, we discuss the potential of modulating the cell cycle of ES cells for the large-scale generation of functionally mature β cells in vitro.
Further understanding of the factors that modulate the ES cell cycle will lead to new approaches to enhance the production of functional mature insulin-producing cells, and yield a reliable system to generate bona fide β cells in vitro.'] 

21446404 Magnetic field-magnetic nanoparticle culture system used to grow in vitro murine embryonic stem cells.
['The in vitro growth of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is usually obtained in the presence of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), but new methods for in vitro expansion of ESCs should be developed due to their potential clinical use.
This study aims to establish a culture system to expand and maintain ESCs in the absence of MEF by using murine embryonic stem cells (mECS) as a model of embryonic stem cell.
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were used for growing mESCs in the presence of an external magnetic field, creating the magnetic field-magnetic nanoparticle (MF-MNP) culture system.
The growth characteristics were evaluated showing a doubling time slightly higher for mESCs cultivated in the presence of the system than in the presence of the MEF.
The undifferentiated state was characterized by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, alkaline phosphatase activity and electron microscopy.
Murine embryonic stem cells cultivated in presence of the MF-MNP culture system exhibited Oct-4 and Nanog expression and high alkaline phosphatase activity.
Ultrastructural morphology showed that the MF-MNP culture system did not interfere with processes that cause structural changes in the cytoplasm or nucleus.
The MF-MNP culture system provides a tool for in vitro expansion of mESCs and could contribute to studies that aim the therapeutic use of embryonic stem cells.'] 

20715903 Fetal stromal niches enhance human embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic differentiation and globin switch.
['Hematopoiesis during mammalian embryonic development has been perceived as a migratory phenomenon, from the yolk sac blood island to the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, fetal liver (FL), and subsequently, the fetal bone marrow.
In this study, we investigated the effects of primary stromal cells from fetal hematopoietic niches and their conditioned media (CM), applied singly or in sequential orders, on induction of human embryonic stem cells, H1, H9, and H14 lines, to hematopoietic cells.
Our results demonstrated that stromal support of FL, AGM\u2009+\u2009FL, and AGM\u2009+\u2009FL\u2009+\u2009fetal bone marrow significantly increased the proliferation of embryoid bodies (EB) at day 18 of hematopoietic induction in the presence of thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, and Flt-3 ligand.
AGM\u2009+\u2009FL also increased hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) formation.
CM did not enhance EB proliferation but CM of FL and AGM\u2009+\u2009FL significantly increased the density of total CFU and early erythroid (burst-forming unit) progenitors.
Increased commitment to the hematopoietic lineage was demonstrated by enhanced expressions of CD45, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globins in CFU at day 32, compared with EB at day 18.
CM of FL significantly increased these globin expressions, indicating enhanced switches from embryonic to fetal and adult erythropoiesis.
Over 50% and 10% of cells derived from CFU expressed CD45 and beta-globin proteins, respectively.
Expressions of hematopoietic regulatory genes (Bmi-1, β-Catenin, Hox B4, GATA-1) were increased in EB or CFU cultures supported by FL or sequential CM. Our study has provided a strategy for derivation of hematopoietic cells from embryonic stem cells under the influence of primary hematopoietic niches and CM, particularly the FL.'] 

26108678 Alternative Routes to Induce Naïve Pluripotency in Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells exhibiting primed pluripotency unlike mouse ESCs (mESCs), which acquire a naïve pluripotent state.
Efforts have been made to trigger naïve pluripotency in hESCs for subsequent unbiased lineage-specific differentiation, a common conundrum faced by primed pluripotent hESCs due to heterogeneity in gene expression existing within and between hESC lines.
This required either ectopic expression of naïve genes such as NANOG and KLF2 or inclusion of multiple pluripotency-associated factors.
We report here a novel combination of small molecules and growth factors in culture medium (2i/LIF/basic fibroblast growth factor\u2009+\u2009Ascorbic Acid\u2009+\u2009Forskolin) facilitating rapid induction of transgene-free naïve pluripotency in hESCs, as well as in mESCs, which has not been shown earlier.
The converted naïve hESCs survived long-term single-cell passaging, maintained a normal karyotype, upregulated naïve pluripotency genes, and exhibited dependence on signaling pathways similar to naïve mESCs.
Moreover, they undergo global DNA demethylation and show a distinctive long noncoding RNA profile.
We propose that in our medium, the FGF signaling pathway via PI3K/AKT/mTORC induced the conversion of primed hESCs toward naïve pluripotency.
Collectively, we demonstrate an alternate route to capture naïve pluripotency in hESCs that is fast, reproducible, supports naïve mESC derivation, and allows efficient differentiation.'] 

18988711 Role of natural-killer group 2 member D ligands and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in natural killer cell-mediated lysis of murine embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
['The transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells into infarcted heart has been shown to improve heart function in animal models.
However, immune rejection of transplanted cells may hamper the clinical application of this approach.
Natural killer (NK) cells could play an important role in this process in both autologous and allogeneic settings by eliminating cells expressing low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.
Here we characterize embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESCM) in terms of their sensitivity to NK cells.
We show that despite expression of very low levels of MHC class I molecules, murine ESCM were neither recognized nor lysed by activated syngeneic NK cells in vitro.
In contrast, undifferentiated ES cells expressing similarly low levels of MHC class I molecules as ESCM were recognized and lysed by NK cells.
This differential susceptibility results from the differential expression of ligands for the major activating natural killer cell receptor natural-killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on ES cells versus ESCM. NKG2D ligands and ICAM-1 were expressed on ES cells but were absent from ESCM. Undifferentiated ES cells were lysed by NK cells in a perforin-dependent manner.
However, simultaneous blockade of NKG2D and ICAM-1 by antibodies inhibited this killing.
These data suggest that in the course of differentiation ESCM acquire resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis by downregulating the expression of ligands required for activation of NK cell cytotoxicity.'] 

23389418 Human embryonic stem cells differentiate into functional renal proximal tubular-like cells.
['Renal cells are used in basic research, disease models, tissue engineering, drug screening, and in vitro toxicology.
In order to provide a reliable source of human renal cells, we developed a protocol for the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into renal epithelial cells.
The differentiated stem cells expressed markers characteristic of renal proximal tubular cells and their precursors, whereas markers of other renal cell types were not expressed or expressed at low levels.
Marker expression patterns of these differentiated stem cells and in vitro cultivated primary human renal proximal tubular cells were comparable.
The differentiated stem cells showed morphological and functional characteristics of renal proximal tubular cells, and generated tubular structures in vitro and in vivo.
In addition, the differentiated stem cells contributed in organ cultures for the formation of simple epithelia in the kidney cortex.
Bioreactor experiments showed that these cells retained their functional characteristics under conditions as applied in bioartificial kidneys.
Thus, our results show that human embryonic stem cells can differentiate into renal proximal tubular-like cells.
Our approach would provide a source for human renal proximal tubular cells that are not affected by problems associated with immortalized cell lines or primary cells.'] 

24734955 Safety and efficacy of embryonic stem cell microenvironment in a leukemia mouse model.
['The embryonic stem cell (ESC) microenvironment can promote the proliferation of terminal cells and reduce the invasiveness of tumor cells.
However, implanting ESCs directly in vivo can result in tumorigenicity, immune rejection after differentiation, and graft-versus-host reaction.
Therefore, safety is very important in the clinical application of ESCs.
We injected ESCs modified with a suicide gene into a leukemia mouse model through peripheral blood to observe the treatment effectiveness.
In addition, according to the pre-test, we set the time point of differentiation after transplantation and then activated the suicide gene to kill the ESCs that we had initially implanted, hoping to avoid the risks mentioned earlier.
Our results indicated that the body weight and survival rates of mice treated with an ESC microenvironment increased, and leukemic cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow decreased compared with untreated mice.
There was no obvious teratoma in mice that received ESC therapy and induced the suicide gene at the proper time during the observation period, while an apparent teratoma was observed in the lungs of mice which received ESC therapy and never induced the suicide gene.
Therefore, the ESC microenvironment can promote self-healing of the in vivo microenvironment.
Inducing the suicide gene at the appropriate time can reduce or even avoid tumorigenicity and immune rejection after transplantation of ESCs in vivo and improve the safety of their clinical application.']

26269433 Nitric Oxide-cGMP-PKG Pathway Acts on Orai1 to Inhibit the Hypertrophy of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.
['Cardiac hypertrophy is an abnormal enlargement of heart muscle.
It frequently results in congestive heart failure, which is a leading cause of human death.
Previous studies demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO), cyclic GMP (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway can inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and thus improve cardiac function.
However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.
Here, based on the human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hESC-CM) model system, we showed that Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), is the downstream effector of PKG. Treatment of hESC-CMs with an α-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) caused a marked hypertrophy, which was accompanied by an upregulation of Orai1.
Moreover, suppression of Orai1 expression/activity using Orai1-siRNAs or a dominant-negative construct Orai1(G98A) inhibited the hypertrophy, suggesting that Orai1-mediated SOCE is indispensable for the PE-induced hypertrophy of hESC-CMs.
In addition, the hypertrophy was inhibited by NO and cGMP via activating PKG.
Importantly, substitution of Ala for Ser(34) in Orai1 abolished the antihypertrophic effects of NO, cGMP, and PKG.
Furthermore, PKG could directly phosphorylate Orai1 at Ser(34) and thus prevent Orai1-mediated SOCE.
Together, we conclude that NO, cGMP, and PKG inhibit the hypertrophy of hESC-CMs via PKG-mediated phosphorylation on Orai1-Ser-34.
These results provide novel mechanistic insights into the action of cGMP-PKG-related antihypertrophic agents, such as NO donors and sildenafil.'] 

26091100 Tetraploid Embryonic Stem Cells Maintain Pluripotency and Differentiation Potency into Three Germ Layers.
['Polyploid amphibians and fishes occur naturally in nature, while polyploid mammals do not.
For example, tetraploid mouse embryos normally develop into blastocysts, but exhibit abnormalities and die soon after implantation.
Thus, polyploidization is thought to be harmful during early mammalian development.
However, the mechanisms through which polyploidization disrupts development are still poorly understood.
In this study, we aimed to elucidate how genome duplication affects early mammalian development.
To this end, we established tetraploid embryonic stem cells (TESCs) produced from the inner cell masses of tetraploid blastocysts using electrofusion of two-cell embryos in mice and studied the developmental potential of TESCs.
We demonstrated that TESCs possessed essential pluripotency and differentiation potency to form teratomas, which differentiated into the three germ layers, including diploid embryonic stem cells.
TESCs also contributed to the inner cell masses in aggregated chimeric blastocysts, despite the observation that tetraploid embryos fail in normal development soon after implantation in mice.
In TESCs, stability after several passages, colony morphology, and alkaline phosphatase activity were similar to those of diploid ESCs.
TESCs also exhibited sufficient expression and localization of pluripotent markers and retained the normal epigenetic status of relevant reprogramming factors.
TESCs proliferated at a slower rate than ESCs, indicating that the difference in genomic dosage was responsible for the different growth rates.
Thus, our findings suggested that mouse ESCs maintained intrinsic pluripotency and differentiation potential despite tetraploidization, providing insights into our understanding of developmental elimination in polyploid mammals.']

22961983 Induction of cancerous stem cells during embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Stem cell maintenance depends on their surrounding microenvironment, and aberrancies in the environment have been associated with tumorigenesis.
However, it remains to be elucidated whether an environmental aberrancy can act as a carcinogenic stress for cellular transformation of differentiating stem cells into cancer stem cells.
Here, utilizing mouse embryonic stem cells as a model, it was illustrated that environmental aberrancy during differentiation leads to the emergence of pluripotent cells showing cancerous characteristics.
Analogous to precancerous stages, DNA lesions were spontaneously accumulated during embryonic stem cell differentiation under aberrational environments, which activates barrier responses such as senescence and apoptosis.
However, overwhelming such barrier responses, piled-up spheres were subsequently induced from the previously senescent cells.
The sphere cells exhibit aneuploidy and dysfunction of the Arf-p53 module as well as enhanced tumorigenicity and a strong self-renewal capacity, suggesting development of cancerous stem cells.
Our current study suggests that stem cells differentiating in an aberrational environment are at risk of cellular transformation into malignant counterparts.'] 

23370908 Heparan sulfate: a key regulator of embryonic stem cell fate.
['Heparan sulfate (HS) belongs to a class of glycosaminoglycans and is a highly sulfated, linear polysaccharide.
HS biosynthesis and modification involves numerous enzymes.
HS exists as part of glycoproteins named HS proteoglycans, which are expressed abundantly on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix.
HS interacts with numerous proteins, including growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion molecules, and thereby regulates important developmental processes in invertebrates and vertebrates.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are distinguished by their characteristics of self-renewal and pluripotency.
Self-renewal allows ESCs to proliferate indefinitely in their undifferentiated state, whereas pluripotency implies their capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers and ultimately all cell types of the adult body.
Both traits are tightly regulated by numerous cell signaling pathways.
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of HS in the modulation of ESC functions, specifically their lineage fate.
Here, we review the current advances that have been made in understanding the structural changes of HS during ESC differentiation and in deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which HS modulates cell fate.
Finally, we discuss the applications of heparinoids and chemical inhibitors of HS biosynthesis for the manipulation of ESC culture and directed differentiation.'] 

23807224 MicroRNA-195 targets ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2 to induce apoptosis in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells.
['Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have great potential in cell therapy, drug screening and toxicity testing of neural degenerative diseases.
However, the molecular regulation of their proliferation and apoptosis, which needs to be revealed before clinical application, is largely unknown.
MicroRNA miR-195 is known to be expressed in the brain and is involved in a variety of proapoptosis or antiapoptosis processes in cancer cells.
Here, we defined the proapoptotic role of miR-195 in NPCs derived from two independent hESC lines (human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, hESC-NPCs).
Overexpression of miR-195 in hESC-NPCs induced extensive apoptotic cell death.
Consistently, global transcriptional microarray analyses indicated that miR-195 primarily regulated genes associated with apoptosis in hESC-NPCs.
Mechanistically, a small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2 (ARL2) was identified as a direct target of miR-195.
Silencing ARL2 in hESC-NPCs provoked an apoptotic phenotype resembling that of miR-195 overexpression, revealing for the first time an essential role of ARL2 for the survival of human NPCs.
Moreover, forced expression of ALR2 could abolish the cell number reduction caused by miR-195 overexpression.
Interestingly, we found that paraquat, a neurotoxin, not only induced apoptosis but also increased miR-195 and reduced ARL2 expression in hESC-NPCs, indicating the possible involvement of miR-195 and ARL2 in neurotoxin-induced NPC apoptosis.
Notably, inhibition of miR-195 family members could block neurotoxin-induced NPC apoptosis.
Collectively, miR-195 regulates cell apoptosis in a context-dependent manner through directly targeting ARL2.
The finding of the critical role of ARL2 for the survival of human NPCs and association of miR-195 and ARL2 with neurotoxin-induced apoptosis have important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms that control NPC survival and would facilitate our manipulation of the neurological pathogenesis.']

26608863 Using Zinc Finger Nuclease Technology to Generate CRX-Reporter Human Embryonic Stem Cells as a Tool to Identify and Study the Emergence of Photoreceptors Precursors
During Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation.
["The purpose of this study was to generate human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines harboring the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter at the endogenous loci of the Cone-Rod Homeobox (CRX) gene, a key transcription factor in retinal development.
Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to cleave in the 3' UTR of CRX were transfected into hESCs along with a donor construct containing homology to the target region, eGFP reporter, and a puromycin selection cassette.
Following selection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis of antibiotic resistant clones indicated targeted integration of the reporter cassette at the 3' of the CRX gene, generating a CRX-GFP fusion.
Further analysis of a clone exhibiting homozygote integration of the GFP reporter was conducted suggesting genomic stability was preserved and no other copies of the targeting cassette were inserted elsewhere within the genome.
This clone was selected for differentiation towards the retinal lineage.
Immunocytochemistry of sections obtained from embryoid bodies and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR of GFP positive and negative subpopulations purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting during the differentiation indicated a significant correlation between GFP and endogenous CRX expression.
Furthermore, GFP expression was found in photoreceptor precursors emerging during hESC differentiation, but not in the retinal pigmented epithelium, retinal ganglion cells, or neurons of the developing inner nuclear layer.
Together our data demonstrate the successful application of ZFN technology to generate CRX-GFP labeled hESC lines, which can be used to study and isolate photoreceptor precursors during hESC differentiation."] 

25748933 Transient pairing of homologous Oct4 alleles accompanies the onset of embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['The relationship between chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation is an area of intense investigation.
We characterized the spatial relationships between alleles of the Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes in single cells during the earliest stages of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and during embryonic development.
We describe homologous pairing of the Oct4 alleles during ESC differentiation and embryogenesis, and we present evidence that pairing is correlated with the kinetics of ESC differentiation.
Importantly, we identify critical DNA elements within the Oct4 promoter/enhancer region that mediate pairing of Oct4 alleles.
Finally, we show that mutation of OCT4/SOX2 binding sites within this region abolishes inter-chromosomal interactions and affects accumulation of the repressive\xa0H3K9me2 modification at the Oct4 enhancer.
Our findings demonstrate that chromatin organization and transcriptional programs are intimately connected in ESCs and that the dynamic positioning of the Oct4 alleles is associated with the transition from pluripotency to lineage specification.'] 

25185564 Reptin regulates pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and somatic cell reprogramming through Oct4-dependent mechanism.
['Oct4 has been implicated in regulation of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.
However, the molecular mechanisms involved in Oct4-dependent regulation of pluripotency and reprogramming have not been clear.
To gain insight into the mechanism of regulation of Oct4-mediated self-renewal of ESCs and reprogramming of somatic cells, we attempted to identify Oct4-binding proteins using affinity purification and mass spectrometry.
We identified Reptin, a key component of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, as an Oct4-binding protein.
Depletion of endogenous Reptin using lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to a decrease in the number and size of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies of mouse ESCs.
In addition, shRNA-mediated silencing of Reptin resulted in decreased expression of pluripotency-specific marker genes, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and SSEA-1.
Results of the Oct4 reporter assay showed synergism between Oct4 and Reptin, and depletion of endogenous Reptin abolished Oct4 transcriptional activity.
Results of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the overlapping interaction of Reptin and Oct4 to CR4 in the Oct4 enhancer in ESCs.
Knockdown of Reptin using shRNA suppressed the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells, whereas overexpression of Reptin resulted in enhanced efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell generation.
These results strongly suggest that Reptin plays a key role in maintaining the pluripotency of ESCs and in establishing the pluripotency during reprogramming of somatic cells by regulation of Oct4-mediated gene regulation.']

Our goal was to devise a protocol for the PEI-mediated transfection of mouse ESCs that was comparable in ease to commercial transfection reagents.
For these studies, we compared PEI transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity to a well-known liposomal transfection reagent, Lipofectamine2000(™) (LF2K), using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, cell viability assays, and Western blotting.
We provide evidence that PEI transfection of mouse ESCs compares favorably to LF2K.

26036698 Selection of Antibodies Interfering with Cell Surface Receptor Signaling Using Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation.
['Antibodies able to bind and modify the function of cell surface signaling components in vivo are increasingly being used as therapeutic drugs.
The identification of such "functional" antibodies from within large antibody pools is, therefore, the subject of intense research.
Here we describe a novel cell-based expression and reporting system for the identification of functional antibodies from antigen-binding populations preselected with phage display.
The system involves inducible expression of the antibody gene population from the Rosa-26 locus of embryonic stem (ES) cells, followed by secretion of the antibodies during ES cell differentiation.
Target antigens are cell-surface signaling components (receptors or ligands) with a known effect on the direction of cell differentiation (FGFR1 mediating ES cell exit from self renewal in this particular protocol).
Therefore, inhibition or activation of these components by functional antibodies in a few elite clones causes a shift in the differentiation outcomes of these clones, leading to their phenotypic selection.
Functional antibody genes are then recovered from positive clones and used to produce the purified antibodies, which can be tested for their ability to affect cell fates exogenously.
Identified functional antibody genes can be further introduced in different stem cell types.
Inducible expression of functional antibodies has a temporally controlled protein-knockdown capability, which can be used to study the unknown role of the signaling pathway in different developmental contexts.
Moreover, it provides a means for control of stem cell differentiation with potential in vivo applications.'] 

25692793 Generation of embryonic stem cells from mouse adipose-tissue derived cells via somatic cell nuclear transfer.
['Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs), or into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the "Yamanaka method."
However, recent studies have indicated that mouse and human iPSCs are prone to epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations, and that NT-ESCs correspond more closely to ESCs derived from in vitro fertilized embryos than iPSCs.
In addition, the procedure of NT-ESCs does not involve gene modification.
Demonstration of generation of NT-ESCs using an easily-accessible source of adult cell types would be very important.
Adipose tissue is a source of readily accessible donor cells and can be isolated from both males and females at different ages.
Here we report that NT-ESCs can be generated from adipose tissue-derived cells (ADCs).
At morphological, mRNA and protein levels, these NT-ESCs show classic ESC colonies, exhibit alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and display normal diploid karyotypes.
Importantly, these cells express pluripotent markers including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and SSEA-1.
Furthermore, they can differentiate in vivo into various types of cells from 3 germinal layers by teratoma formation assays.
This study demonstrates for the first time that ESCs can be generated from the adipose tissue by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and suggests that ADCs can be a new donor-cell type for potential therapeutic cloning.']

For example, most mammalian cells cannot proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation even though glutamine is a non-essential amino acid.
Here we show that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown under conditions that maintain naive pluripotency are capable of proliferation in the absence of exogenous glutamine.
Despite this, ES cells consume high levels of exogenous glutamine when the metabolite is available.
In comparison to more differentiated cells, naive ES cells utilize both glucose and glutamine catabolism to maintain a high level of intracellular α-ketoglutarate (αKG).
Consequently, naive ES cells exhibit an elevated αKG to succinate ratio that promotes histone/DNA demethylation and maintains pluripotency.
Direct manipulation of the intracellular αKG/succinate ratio is sufficient to regulate multiple chromatin modifications, including H3K27me3 and ten-eleven translocation (Tet)-dependent DNA demethylation, which contribute to the regulation of pluripotency-associated gene expression.
In vitro, supplementation with cell-permeable αKG directly supports ES-cell self-renewal while cell-permeable succinate promotes differentiation.
This work reveals that intracellular αKG/succinate levels can contribute to the maintenance of cellular identity and have a mechanistic role in the transcriptional and epigenetic state of stem cells.'] 

24424206 The effect of cyclic stretch on maturation and 3D tissue formation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
['The goal of cardiac tissue engineering is to restore function to the damaged myocardium with regenerative constructs.
Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) can produce viable, contractile, three-dimensional grafts that function in vivo.
We sought to enhance the viability and functional maturation of cardiac tissue constructs by cyclical stretch.
hESC-CMs seeded onto gelatin-based scaffolds underwent cyclical stretching.
Histological analysis demonstrated a greater proportion of cardiac troponin T-expressing cells in stretched than non-stretched constructs, and flow sorting demonstrated a higher proportion of cardiomyocytes.
Ultrastructural assessment showed that cells in stretched constructs had a more mature phenotype, characterized by greater cell elongation, increased gap junction expression, and better contractile elements.
Real-time PCR revealed enhanced mRNA expression of genes associated with cardiac maturation as well as genes encoding cardiac ion channels.
Calcium imaging confirmed that stretched constructs contracted more frequently, with shorter calcium cycle duration.
Epicardial implantation of constructs onto ischemic rat hearts demonstrated the feasibility of this platform, with enhanced survival and engraftment of transplanted cells in the stretched constructs.
This uniaxial stretching system may serve as a platform for the production of cardiac tissue-engineered constructs for translational applications.'] 

25863442 Polysialic acid modification of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM 1 in human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
['Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are the progenitors of myelinating oligodendrocytes in brain development and repair.
Successful myelination depends on the control of adhesiveness during OPC migration and axon contact formation.
The decoration of cell surface proteins with the glycan polysialic acid (polySia) is a key regulatory element of OPC interactions during development and under pathological conditions.
By far the major protein carrier of polySia is the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, but recently, polysialylation of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM 1 has been detected in the developing mouse brain.
In mice, polySia-SynCAM 1 is associated with cells expressing NG2, a marker of a heterogeneous precursor cell population, which is the primary source for oligodendrocytes in development and myelin repair but can also give rise to astrocytes and possibly neurons.
It is not yet clear if polySia-SynCAM 1 is expressed by OPCs and its occurrence in humans is elusive.
By generating uniform human embryonic stem cell-derived OPC cultures, we demonstrate that polySia is present on human OPCs but down-regulated during differentiation into myelin basic protein-positive oligodendrocytes.
PolySia on NCAM resides on the isoforms NCAM-180 and NCAM-140, and SynCAM 1 is identified as a novel polySia acceptor in human OPCs.'] 

21930391 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells support the survival and undifferentiated growth of the CGR8 mouse embryonic stem cell line: possible role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).
['Murine embryonic stem cells (muESC) are maintained and expanded in vitro by culturing in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or by coculturing on murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF).
Previously we have shown that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) promote the survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells.
In the present study we investigated whether LSEC might promote the survival and undifferentiated growth of muESC.
For these purposes, muESC (CGR8 cell line) were cultured on LSEC monolayers (muESC/LSEC) or in the presence of conditioned medium from LSEC cultures (muESC/LSEC-CM), both in the absence of LIF. Microscopic observation showed the growth of undifferentiated ESC colonies in both muESC/LSEC or muESC/LSEC-CM cultures.
A significant reduction in the growth of undifferentiated ESC colonies was observed when ESC were cultured in LSEC-CM previously incubated with anti-LIF. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that LSEC constitutively express LIF at the mRNA and protein level.
At different times of culture, muESC were harvested and analyzed for the expression of embryonic markers (SSEA-1 and Oct-4) and differentiation capacity.
Flow cytometry analysis showed the presence of a higher percentage of muESC (>90%) expressing SSEA-1 in muESC/LSEC-CM, as compared with muESC/LSEC cocultures.
muESC obtained from both types of cultures formed embryoid bodies in vitro, and form teratomas in testicles of mice.
These results provide the first evidence that LSEC support the in vitro survival, self-renewal, undifferentiated growth and differentiation capacity of the muESC CGR8 cell line.'] 

21456900 Differentiation of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal progenitors into retinal cells by Sonic hedgehog and/or retinal pigmented epithelium and transplantation into the subretinal space of sodium iodate-injected rabbits.
['Transplantation of retinal cells has recently provided a promising therapeutic approach for retinal degeneration.
Here, we differentiated initially retinal progenitors (RPs) from adherent feeder-free human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with the use of defined media supplemented with a specific combination of growth factors.
The differentiated RPs highly (>80%) expressed related molecular features that included Six3 at an early stage in addition to Crx, Rx, Pax6, Otx2, and Chx10 at later stage.
Next, we examined the induction of photoreceptors by Shh and/or the coculture of rabbit retinal pigmented epithelium with hESCs-derived RPs.
The differentiation of retinal cells was demonstrated by protein and gene expression in all groups.
However, S-Opsin, a cone photoreceptor marker, had higher expression in the presence of Shh, whereas expressions of Gli and Hes1 decreased in the same group.
Finally, hESC-derived RPs were treated with Shh transplanted into the subretinal space of sodium iodate-injected albino-type adult rabbits and analyzed 4 weeks later.
Transplanted retinal cells survived, migrated into retinal layers, and restored a small but significant B-wave.
The grafted cells expressed photoreceptor markers, S-Opsin and Rhodopsin.
Our results indicate that putative hESC-derived retinal cells express related genes and proteins.
Further, our results show that retinal-like cells can be useful replacements for photoreceptors in retinal diseases.'] 

25936968 Embryonic stem cell-derived osteocytes are capable of responding to mechanical oscillatory hydrostatic pressure.
['Osteoblasts can be derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by a 30 day differentiation process, whereupon cells spontaneously differentiate upon removal of LIF and respond to exogenously added 1,25α(OH)2 vitamin D3 with enhanced matrix mineralization.
However, bone is a load-bearing tissue that has to perform under dynamic pressure changes during daily movement, a capacity that is executed by osteocytes.
At present, it is unclear whether ESC-derived osteogenic cultures contain osteocytes and whether these are capable of responding to a relevant cyclic hydrostatic compression stimulus.
Here, we show that ESC-osteoblastogenesis is followed by the generation of osteocytes and then mechanically load ESC-derived osteogenic cultures in a compression chamber using a cyclic loading protocol.
Following mechanical loading of the cells, iNOS mRNA was upregulated 31-fold, which was consistent with a role for iNOS as an immediate early mechanoresponsive gene.
Further analysis of matrix and bone-specific genes suggested a cellular response in favor of matrix remodeling.
Immediate iNOS upregulation also correlated with a concomitant increase in Ctnnb1 and Tcf7l2 mRNAs along with increased nuclear TCF transcriptional activity, while the mRNA for the repressive Tcf7l1 was downregulated, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the noted matrix remodeling.
We conclude that ESC-derived osteocytes are capable of responding to relevant mechanical cues, at least such that mimic oscillatory compression stress, which not only provides new basic understanding, but also information that likely will be important for their use in cell-based regenerative therapies.'] 

25634576 Exogenous supplementation of Activin A enhances germ cell differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.
['Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived in the presence of Activin A (ActA) demonstrate an increased differentiation propensity toward the germ cell lineage.
In addition, mouse epiblast stem cells and mouse epiblast-like cells are poised toward germ cell differentiation and are derived in the presence of ActA. We therefore investigated whether supplementation with ActA enhances in vitro hESC differentiation toward germ cell lineage.
ActA up-regulated early primordial germ cell (PGC) genes STELLA/DPPA3 (developmental pluripotency associated 3) and tyrosine kinase receptor cKIT in both ActA-derived and standard-derived hESCs indicating its role in priming hESCs toward the PGC lineage.
Indeed, ActA plus bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) strongly increased germ cell differentiation potential of hESCs based on the high expression of late PGC markers DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) and VASA/DDX4 (DEAD-box polypeptide 4) at mRNA and protein level.
Hence, the combination of ActA with BMP4 provides an additional boost for hESCs to develop into postmigratory germ cells.
Together with increased VASA expression in the presence of ActA and BMP4, we also observed up-regulation of endoderm-specific genes GATA4 (GATA binding protein 4) and GATA6.
Finally, we were able to further mature these in vitro-derived PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) by culturing them in in vitro maturation (IVM) medium, resulting in the formation of germ cell-like clusters and induction of meiotic gene expression.
In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time a synergism between ActA and BMP4 in facilitating germ cell-directed differentiation of hESCs, which is enhanced by extended culture in IVM medium, as shown by cytoplasmic VASA-expressing PGCLCs.
We propose a novel relationship between the endoderm and germ cell lineage during hESC differentiation.']

26395809 Cardiomyogenesis of embryonic stem cells upon purinergic receptor activation by ADP and ATP. ["Purinergic signaling may be involved in embryonic development of the heart.
In the present study, the effects of purinergic receptor stimulation on cardiomyogenesis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were investigated.
ADP or ATP increased the number of cardiac clusters and cardiac cells, as well as beating frequency.
Cardiac-specific genes showed enhanced expression of α-MHC, MLC2v, α-actinin, connexin 45 (Cx45), and HCN4, on both gene and protein levels upon ADP/ATP treatment, indicating increased cardiomyogenesis and pacemaker cell differentiation.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis of purinergic receptor expression demonstrated presence of P2X1, P2X4, P2X6, P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 on differentiating ES cells.
ATP and ADP as well as the P2X agonists β,γ-methylenadenosine 5'-triphosphate (β,γ-MetATP) and 8-bromoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-Br-ATP) but not UTP or UDP transiently increased the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) as evaluated by the calcium indicator Fluo-4, whereas no changes in membrane potential were observed.
[Ca(2+)](i)
transients induced by ADP/ATP were abolished by the phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) inhibitor U-73122, suggesting involvement of metabotropic P2Y receptors.
Furthermore, partial inhibition of [Ca(2+)](i)
transients was achieved in presence of MRS2179, a selective P2Y1 receptor antagonist, whereas PPADS, a non-selective P2 receptor inhibitor, completely abolished the [Ca(2+)](i) response.
Consequently, cardiomyocyte differentiation was decreased upon long term co-incubation of cells with ADP and P2 receptor antagonists.
In summary, activation of purinoceptors and the subsequent [Ca(2+)](i) transients enhance the differentiation of ES cells toward cardiomyocytes.
Purinergic receptor stimulation may be a promising strategy to drive the fate of pluripotent ES cells into a particular population of cardiomyocytes."] 

25375206 Ormocomp-modified glass increases collagen binding and promotes the adherence and maturation of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells.
['In in vitro live-cell imaging, it would be beneficial to grow and assess human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells on thin, transparent, rigid surfaces such as cover glasses.
In this study, we assessed how the silanization of glass with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MAPTMS), or polymer-ceramic material Ormocomp affects the surface properties, protein binding, and maturation of hESC-RPE cells.
The surface properties were studied by contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and a protein binding assay.
The cell adherence and proliferation were evaluated by culturing hESCRPE cells on collagen IV-coated untreated or silanized surfaces for 42 days.
The Ormocomp treatment significantly increased the hydrophobicity and roughness of glass surfaces compared to the APTES and MAPTMS treatments.
The XPS results indicated that the Ormocomp treatment changes the chemical composition of the glass surface by increasing the carbon content and the number of C-O/═O bonds.
The protein-binding test confirmed that the Ormocomp-treated surfaces bound more collagen IV than did APTES- or MAPTMS-treated surfaces.
All of the silane treatments increased the number of cells: after 42 days of culture, Ormocomp had 0.38, APTES had 0.16, MAPTMS had 0.19, and untreated glass had only 0.062, all presented as million cells cm(-2).
There were no differences in cell numbers compared to smoother to rougher Ormocomp surfaces, suggesting that the surface chemistry and, more specifically, the collagen binding in combination with Ormocomp are beneficial to hESC-RPE cell culture.
This study clearly demonstrates that Ormocomp treatment combined with collagen coating significantly increases hESC-RPE cell attachment compared to commonly used silanizing agents APTES and MAPTMS. Ormocomp silanization could thus enable the use of microscopic live cell imaging methods for hESC-RPE cells.'] 

26176320 Suppressor of Fused Plays an Important Role in Regulating Mesodermal Differentiation of Murine Embryonic Stem Cells
In Vivo.
['The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays fundamental roles during embryonic development and tumorigenesis.
Previously, we have shown that ablation of the tumor suppressor and negative regulator, Suppressor of fused (Sufu), within this pathway causes embryonic lethality around E9.5 in the mouse.
In this study, we examine how lack of Sufu influences early cell fate determination processes.
We established embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines from preimplantation Sufu(-/-) and wild-type mouse embryos and show that these ESCs express the typical pluripotency markers, alkaline phosphatase, SSEA-1, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog.
We demonstrate that these ESCs express all core Hh pathway components and that glioma-associated protein (Gli)1 mRNA levels are increased in Sufu(-/-) ESCs.
Upon spontaneous differentiation of Sufu(-/-) ESCs into embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro, the Hh pathway is strongly upregulated as indicated by an increase in both Gli1 and patched1 (Ptch1) gene expression.
Interestingly, developing Sufu(-/-) EBs were smaller than their wild-type counterparts and showed decreased expression of the ectodermal markers, Fgf5 and Sox1.
In vivo teratoma formation revealed that Sufu(-/-) ESCs have a limited capacity for differentiation as the resulting tumors lacked the mesodermal derivatives, cartilage and bone.
However, Sufu(-/-)
ESCs were able to develop into chondrocytes and osteocytes in vitro, which suggests a differential response of ESCs compared with in vivo conditions.
Our findings suggest a regulatory function of the Hh signaling pathway in early mesodermal cell fate determination and emphasize the role of Sufu as a key molecule in this process.'] 

24641164 Cationic surface charge combined with either vitronectin or laminin dictates the evolution of human embryonic stem cells/microcarrier aggregates and cell growth in agitated cultures.
["The expansion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) for biomedical applications generally compels a defined, reliable, and scalable platform.
Bioreactors offer a three-dimensional culture environment that relies on the implementation of microcarriers (MC), as supports for cell anchorage and their subsequent growth.
Polystyrene microspheres/MC coated with adhesion-promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, vitronectin (VN), or laminin (LN) have been shown to support hPSC expansion in a static environment.
However, they are insufficient to promote human embryonic stem cells (hESC) seeding and their expansion in an agitated environment.
The present study describes an innovative technology, consisting of a cationic charge that underlies the ECM coatings.
By combining poly-L-lysine (PLL) with a coating of ECM protein, cell attachment efficiency and cell spreading are improved, thus enabling seeding under agitation in a serum-free medium.
This coating combination also critically enables the subsequent formation and evolution of hPSC/MC aggregates, which ensure cell viability and generate high yields.
Aggregate dimensions of at least 300\u2009μm during early cell growth give rise to ≈15-fold expansion at 7 days' culture.
Increasing aggregate numbers at a quasi-constant size of ≈300\u2009μm indicates hESC growth within a self-regulating microenvironment.
PLL+LN enables cell seeding and aggregate evolution under constant agitation, whereas PLL+VN requires an intermediate 2-day static pause to attain comparable aggregate sizes and correspondingly high expansion yields.
The cells' highly reproducible bioresponse to these defined and characterized MC surface properties is universal across multiple cell lines, thus confirming the robustness of this scalable expansion process in a defined environment."]

23544950 Neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cell derived neuronal progenitors can be regulated by stretchable conducting polymers.
['Electrically conducting polymers are prospective candidates as active substrates for the development of neuroprosthetic devices.
The utility of these substrates for promoting differentiation of embryonic stem cells paves viable routes for regenerative medicine.
Here, we have tuned the electrical and mechanical cues provided to the embryonic stem cells during differentiation by precisely straining the conducting polymer (CP) coated, elastomeric-substrate.
Upon straining the substrates, the neural differentiation pattern occurs in form of aggregates, accompanied by a gradient where substrate interface reveals a higher degree of differentiation.
The CP domains align under linear stress along with the formation of local defect patterns leading to disruption of actin cytoskeleton of cells, and can provide a mechano-transductive basis for the observed changes in the differentiation.
Our results demonstrate that along with biochemical and mechanical cues, conductivity of the polymer plays a major role in cellular differentiation thereby providing another control feature to modulate the differentiation and proliferation of stem cells.'] 

25720370 From Naive to Primed Pluripotency:
In Vitro Conversion of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells in Epiblast Stem Cells.
['Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derive from the inner cell mass (ICM) of a blastocyst at E3.5 while mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) derive from the late epiblast of a post-implantation embryo at E5.5-E7.5.
Both cells are able to differentiate into derivatives of the three germs layers but only ESCs are able to produce chimeras when they are introduced into a blastocyst.
To support the naive state of pluripotency, ESC culture requires Leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) and either serum or inhibitors of Erk and Gsk3 pathways (2i) while the primed pluripotency of EpiSCs is maintained using Activin A and Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2).
It is possible to obtain EpiSCs in vitro starting from ESCs but also to induce ESCs starting from EpiSCs even if this second process is very difficult and inefficient.
In this protocol we describe how we perform the process of conversion from ESCs to EpiSCs.'] 

24958871 Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 are essential for accurate cell division and the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.
['Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) form the core catalytic components of corepressor complexes that modulate gene expression.
In most cell types, deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 is required to generate a discernible phenotype, suggesting their activity is largely redundant.
We have therefore generated an ES cell line in which Hdac1 and Hdac2 can be inactivated simultaneously.
Loss of HDAC1/2 resulted in a 60% reduction in total HDAC activity and a loss of cell viability.
Cell death is dependent upon cell cycle progression, because differentiated, nonproliferating cells retain their viability.
Furthermore, we observe increased mitotic defects, chromatin bridges, and micronuclei, suggesting HDAC1/2 are necessary for accurate chromosome segregation.
Consistent with a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, microarray analysis of Hdac1/2-deleted cells reveals 1,708 differentially expressed genes.
Significantly for the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal, we detected a reduction in the expression of the pluripotent transcription factors, Oct4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Rex1.
HDAC1/2 activity is regulated through binding of an inositol tetraphosphate molecule (IP4) sandwiched between the HDAC and its cognate corepressor.
This raises the important question of whether IP4 regulates the activity of the complex in cells.
By rescuing the viability of double-knockout cells, we demonstrate for the first time (to our knowledge) that mutations that abolish IP4 binding reduce the activity of HDAC1/2 in vivo.
Our data indicate that HDAC1/2 have essential and pleiotropic roles in cellular proliferation and regulate stem cell self-renewal by maintaining expression of key pluripotent transcription factors.'] 

24943736 Endothelial cells mediate islet-specific maturation of human embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells.
['It is well recognized that in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) can be best achieved by closely recapitulating the in vivo developmental niche.
Thus, implementation of directed differentiation strategies has yielded encouraging results in the area of pancreatic islet differentiation.
These strategies have concentrated on direct addition of chemical signals, however, other aspect of the developmental niche are yet to be explored.
During development, pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells grow as an epithelial sheet, which aggregates with endothelial cells (ECs) during the final stages of maturation.
Several findings suggest that the interactions with EC play a role in pancreatic development.
In this study, we recapitulated this phenomenon in an in vitro environment by maturing the human ESC (hESC)-derived PP cells in close contact with ECs.
We find that co-culture with different ECs (but not fibroblast) alone results in pancreatic islet-specific differentiation of hESC-derived PP cells even in the absence of additional chemical induction.
The differentiated cells responded to exogenous glucose levels by enhanced C-peptide synthesis.
The co-culture system aligned well with endocrine development as determined by comprehensive analysis of involved signaling pathways.
By recapitulating cell-cell interaction aspects of the developmental niche we achieved a differentiation model that aligns closely with islet organogenesis.'] 

25979313 Gene Expression Regulation and Pathway Analysis After Valproic Acid and Carbamazepine Exposure in a Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Based Neurodevelopmental Toxicity Assay.
['Differentiating pluripotent stem cells in\xa0vitro have proven useful for the study of developmental toxicity.

The effects observed on gene expression and correlated processes and pathways were in line with processes associated with neural development and pharmaceutical mode of action.
In general, VPA showed a higher number of genes and molecular pathways affected than CBZ.
The response kinetics differed between both compounds, with CBZ showing higher response magnitudes at day 1, versus VPA at day 7.
With this study, we demonstrated the potential and biological relevance of the application of this hESC-based differentiation assay in combination with transcriptomics, as a tool to study neurodevelopmental toxicity.'] 

26119137 WNT/β-catenin signaling affects cell lineage and pluripotency-specific gene expression in bovine blastocysts: prospects for bovine embryonic stem cell derivation.
['Despite many attempts, true bovine embryonic stem cells (bESC) still remain elusive.
The WNT pathway has been associated with stem cell control in vertebrates and its role in pluripotency maintenance has been proven for several mammalian species, including rodents and primates.
Thus, we have aimed to investigate the effect of WNT activation on pluripotency marker gene expression in the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE) and to study the derivation potential of primary bESC lines from blastocysts obtained in the presence of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor (GSK3i).
WNT activity clearly exerted a positive effect on pluripotency gene expression in developing bovine embryos, manifested by upregulation of OCT4, NANOG, REX1, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4 in the ICM and downregulation of CDX2 in the TE.
However, the prolonged exposition of preimplantation embryos to the GSK3i resulted in reduced potential to form primary ESC-like colonies.
The results of bESC derivation experiments allowed us to speculate that the derived cell lines may share features of both naïve and primed ESCs.
Similar to mouse epiblast stem cells and human ESCs, the derived lines grew as flat monolayer colonies intolerant to passaging as single cells.
JAK/STAT signaling was indispensable for proper colony formation and proliferation, yet LIF alone was inefficient to support self-renewal.
Concomitant with the naïve state of mouse ESCs, WNT activity supported by LIF had beneficial effects on cell culture propagation, survival after passage, morphology, and pluripotency-related marker gene expression.
Moreover, colonies derived in the presence of LIF and GSK3i maintained KLF4 transcription over several passages, whereas EpiSCs virtually do not express KLF4.'] 

22623371 Activated charcoal composite biomaterial promotes human embryonic stem cell differentiation toward neuronal lineage.
['Transplantation of biomaterial scaffolds encasing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been proposed as a clinical therapy for various neurological lesions and disorders.
In light of recent developments, artificially synthesized carbon-based biomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have demonstrated feasibility in supporting stem cell attachment and differentiation.
However, the applicability is significantly hampered by evidence of nanotoxic effects on multiple cell types.
Thus, an emergent drive for an innovative carbonaceous biomaterial calls for a safer platform with comparable advantageous characteristics.
Here, we showed for the first time, a natural coal-based activated charcoal (AC) composite biosubstrate can support and promote neuronal differentiation in hESCs.
The bio-friendly AC composite biomatrices resulted in more matured neuron-like cells.
Both of axonal length and density were at least twice as long and abundant, respectively, when compared with control groups.
A functional assay demonstrated that the derived neuron-like cells responded to depolarization-dependent synaptic recycling and may contain active synapses.
In addition, the AC composite substrate can serve to concentrate growth factors and cell adhesion proteins, further encouraging attachment and hESC differentiation.
Moreover, the AC composite biomaterial can potentially be economically manufactured as implantable three-dimensional bioscaffolds, facilitating the regeneration of damaged neural and other tissues.'] 

22889265 Expression of early developmental markers predicts the efficiency of embryonic stem cell differentiation into midbrain dopaminergic neurons.
["Dopaminergic neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells are among the best investigated products of in vitro stem cell differentiation owing to their potential use for neurorestorative therapy of Parkinson's disease.
However, the classical differentiation protocols for both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells generate a limited percentage of dopaminergic neurons and yield a considerable cellular heterogeneity comprising numerous scarcely characterized cell populations.
To improve pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, we established extensive and strictly quantitative gene expression profiles, including markers for pluripotent cells, neural progenitors, non-neural cells, pan-neuronal and glial cells, neurotransmitter phenotypes, midbrain and nonmidbrain populations, floor plate and basal plate populations, as well as for Hedgehog, Fgf, and Wnt signaling pathways.
The profiles were applied to discrete stages of in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells toward the dopaminergic lineage and after transplantation into the striatum of 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned rats.
The comparison of gene expression in vitro with stages in the developing ventral midbrain between embryonic day 11.5 and 13.5 ex vivo revealed dynamic changes in the expression of transcription factors and signaling molecules.
Based on these profiles, we propose quantitative gene expression milestones that predict the efficiency of dopaminergic differentiation achieved at the end point of the protocol, already at earlier stages of differentiation."]

In particular, the derivation and transplantation of corneal stem cells from these populations may result in therapies providing clinical normality of the diseased or damaged cornea.
Although feasible in theory, the lack of donor material in sufficient quantity and quality currently limits such a strategy.
A potential scalable source of corneal cells could be derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).
We developed an in vitro and serum-free corneal differentiation model which displays significant promise.
Our stepwise differentiation model was designed with reference to development and gave rise to cells which displayed similarities to epithelial progenitor cells which can be specified to cells displaying a corneal epithelial phenotype.
We believe our approach is novel, provides a robust model of human development and in the future, may facilitate the generation of corneal epithelial cells that are suitable for clinical use.
Additionally, we demonstrate that following continued cell culture, stem cell-derived corneal epithelial cells undergo transdifferentiation and exhibit squamous metaplasia and therefore, also offer an in vitro model of disease.'] 

26222054 Directed Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells into Prostate Organoids
In Vitro and its Perturbation by Low-Dose Bisphenol A Exposure.
['Studies using rodent and adult human prostate stem-progenitor cell models suggest that developmental exposure to the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA) can predispose to prostate carcinogenesis with aging.
Unknown at present is whether the embryonic human prostate is equally susceptible to BPA during its natural developmental window.
To address this unmet need, we herein report the construction of a pioneer in vitro human prostate developmental model to study the effects of BPA.
The directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into prostatic organoids in a spatial system was accomplished with precise temporal control of growth factors and steroids.
Activin-induced definitive endoderm was driven to prostate specification by combined exposure to WNT10B and FGF10.
Matrigel culture for 20-30 days in medium containing R-Spondin-1, Noggin, EGF, retinoic acid and testosterone was sufficient for mature prostate organoid development.
Immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis confirmed that organoids exhibited cytodifferentiation and functional properties of the human prostate.
Exposure to 1 nM or 10 nM BPA throughout differentiation culture disturbed early morphogenesis in a dose-dependent manner with 1 nM BPA increasing and 10 nM BPA reducing the number of branched structures formed.
While differentiation of branched structures to mature organoids seemed largely unaffected by BPA exposure, the stem-like cell population increased, appearing as focal stem cell nests that have not properly entered lineage commitment rather than the rare isolated stem cells found in normally differentiated structures.
These findings provide the first direct evidence that low-dose BPA exposure targets hESC and perturbs morphogenesis as the embryonic cells differentiate towards human prostate organoids, suggesting that the developing human prostate may be susceptible to disruption by in utero BPA exposures.'] 

20032086 Embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells improve spinal muscular atrophy phenotype in mice.
['Spinal muscular atrophy, characterized by selective loss of lower motor neurons, is an incurable genetic neurological disease leading to infant mortality.
We previously showed that primary neural stem cells derived from spinal cord can ameliorate the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype in mice, but this primary source has limited translational value.
Here, we illustrate that pluripotent stem cells from embryonic stem cells show the same potential therapeutic effects as those derived from spinal cord and offer great promise as an unlimited source of neural stem cells for transplantation.
We found that embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells can differentiate into motor neurons in vitro and in vivo.
In addition, following their intrathecal transplantation into spinal muscular atrophy mice, the neural stem cells, like those derived from spinal cord, survived and migrated to appropriate areas, ameliorated behavioural endpoints and lifespan, and exhibited neuroprotective capability.
Neural stem cells obtained using a drug-selectable embryonic stem cell line yielded the greatest improvements.
As with cells originating from primary tissue, the embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells integrated appropriately into the parenchyma, expressing neuron- and motor neuron-specific markers.
Our results suggest translational potential for the use of pluripotent cells in neural stem cell-mediated therapies and highlight potential safety improvements and benefits of drug selection for neuroepithelial cells.'] 

20058201 Embryonic stem cell marker expression pattern in human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, heart and dermis.
["Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from a variety of human tissues, e.g., bone marrow, adipose tissue, dermis, hair follicles, heart, liver, spleen, dental pulp.
Due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative potential MSCs have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies for a variety of conditions, such as graft versus host disease (GvHD), Crohn's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, cartilage damage and myocardial infarction.
MSC cultures are composed of heterogeneous cell populations.
Complications in defining MSC arise from the fact that different laboratories have employed different tissue sources, extraction, and cultivation methods.
Although cell-surface antigens of MSCs have been extensively explored, there is no conclusive evidence that unique stem cells markers are associated with these adult cells.
Therefore the aim of this study was to examine expression of embryonic stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog, SOX2, alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-4 in adult mesenchymal stem cell populations derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, dermis and heart.
Furthermore, we tested whether human mesenchymal stem cells preserve tissue-specific differences under in vitro culture conditions.
We found that bone marrow MSCs express embryonic stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog, alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-4, adipose tissue and dermis MSCs express Oct4, Nanog, SOX2, alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-4, whereas heart MSCs express Oct4, Nanog, SOX2 and SSEA-4.
Our results also indicate that human adult mesenchymal stem cells preserve tissue-specific differences under in vitro culture conditions during early passages, as shown by distinct germ layer and embryonic stem cell marker expression patterns.
Studies are now needed to determine the functional role of embryonic stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog and SOX2 in adult human MSCs."] 

24690677 Three-step method for proliferation and differentiation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived male germ cells.
['The low efficiency of differentiation into male germ cell (GC)-like cells and haploid germ cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reflects the culture method employed in the two-dimensional (2D)-microenvironment.
In this study, we applied a three-step media and calcium alginate-based 3D-culture system for enhancing the differentiation of hESCs into male germ stem cell (GSC)-like cells and haploid germ cells.
In the first step, embryoid bodies (EBs) were derived from hESCs cultured in EB medium for 3 days and re-cultured for 4 additional days in EB medium with BMP4 and RA to specify GSC-like cells.
In the second step, the resultant cells were cultured in GC-proliferation medium for 7 days.
The GSC-like cells were then propagated after selection using GFR-α1 and were further cultured in GC-proliferation medium for 3 weeks.
In the final step, a 3D-co-culture system using calcium alginate encapsulation and testicular somatic cells was applied to induce differentiation into haploid germ cells, and a culture containing approximately 3% male haploid germ cells was obtained after 2 weeks of culture.
These results demonstrated that this culture system could be used to efficiently induce GSC-like cells in an EB population and to promote the differentiation of ESCs into haploid male germ cells.'] 

23611890 In situ electrochemical detection of embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Stem cell sensors have emerged as a promising technique to electrochemically monitor the functional status and viability of stem cells.
However, efficient electrochemical analysis techniques are required for the development of effective electrochemical stem cell sensors.
In the current study, we report a newly developed electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) system to determine the status of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
1-Naphthly phosphate (1-NP), which was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase into a 1-naphthol on an undifferentiated mouse ES cell, was used as a substrate to electrochemically monitor the differentiation status of mouse ES cells.
The peak current in the cyclic voltammetry of 1-NP increased linearly with the concentration of pure 1-NP (R(2)=0.9623).
On the other hand, the peak current in the electrochemical responses of 1-NP decreased as the number of undifferentiated ES cells increased.
The increased dephosphorylation of 1-NP to 1-naphthol made a decreased electrochemical signal.
Non-toxicity of 1-NP was confirmed.
In conclusion, the proposed electrochemical analysis system can be applied to an electrical stem cell chip for diagnosis, drug detection and on-site monitoring.'] 

23500059 Delivery of definable number of drug or growth factor loaded poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)
microparticles within human embryonic stem cell derived aggregates.
['Embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from embryonic stem cells are used to study processes of differentiation within a three dimensional (3D) cell environment.
In many instances however, EBs are dispersed to single cell suspensions with a subsequent monolayer culture.
Moreover, where the 3D integrity of an EB is maintained, cytokines or drugs of interest to stimulate differentiation are often added directly to the culture medium at fixed concentrations and effects are usually limited to the outer layers of the EB.
The aim of this study was to create an EB model with localised drug and or growth factor delivery directly within the EB.
Using poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) microparticles (MPs) with an average diameter of 13μm, we have demonstrated controllable incorporation of defined numbers of MPs within human ES cell derived EBs, down to 1 MP per EB.
This was achieved by coating MPs with human ES cell lysate and centrifugation of specific ratios of ES cells and MPs to form 3D aggregates.
Using MPs loaded with simvastatin (pro or active drug) or BMP-2, we have demonstrated osteogenic differentiation within the 3D aggregates, maintained in culture for up to 21days, and quantified by real time QPCR for osteocalcin.
Immunostaining for RUNX2 and osteocalcin, and also histochemical staining with picrosirius red to demonstrate collage type 1 and Alizarin red to demonstrate calcium/mineralisation further demonstrated osteogenic differentiation and revealed regional staining associated with the locations of MPs within the aggregates.
We also demonstrated endothelial differentiation within human ES cell-derived aggregates using VEGF loaded MPs.
In conclusion, we demonstrate an effective and reliable approach for engineering stem aggregates with definable number of MPs within the 3D cellular structure.
We also achieved localised osteogenic and endothelial differentiation associated with MPs releasing encapsulated drug molecules or cytokines directly within the cell aggregate.
This provides a powerful tool for controlling and investigating differentiation within 3D cell cultures and has applications to drug delivery, drug discovery, stem cell biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.'] 

23194456 Expression pattern of pluripotent markers in different embryonic developmental stages of buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) embryos and putative embryonic stem cells generated by parthenogenetic activation.
['In this study, we describe the production of buffalo parthenogenetic blastocysts and subsequent isolation of parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell (PGESC)-like cells.
PGESC colonies exhibited dome-shaped morphology and were clearly distinguishable from the feeder layer cells.
Different stages of development of parthenogenetic embryos and derived embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells expressed key ESC-specific markers, including OCT-4, NANOG, SOX-2, FOXD3, REX-1, STAT-3, TELOMERASE, NUCLEOSTEMIN, and cMYC. Immunofluorescence-based studies revealed that the PGESCs were positive for surface-based pluripotent markers, viz.
, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA 1-80, TRA 1-60, CD-9, and CD-90 and exhibited high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity.
PGEC cell-like cells formed embryoid body (EB)-like structures in hanging drop cultures and when cultured for extended period of time spontaneously differentiated into derivatives of three embryonic germ layers as confirmed by RT-PCR for ectodermal (CYTOKERATIN8, NF-68), mesodermal (MSX1, BMP-4, ASA), and endodermal markers (AFP, HNF-4, GATA-4).
Differentiation of PGESCs toward the neuronal lineage was successfully directed by supplementation of serum-containing media with retinoic acid.
Our results indicate that the isolated ESC-like cells from parthenogenetic blastocyst hold properties of ESCs and express markers of pluripotency.
The pluripotency markers were also expressed by early cleavage-stage of buffalo embryos.'] 

26206128 Gene-modified embryonic stem cell test to characterize chemical risks.
['A high-throughput test of cell growth inhibition was performed using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to assess chemical toxicities.
We herein demonstrated using a 96-well culture plate approach and the MTT assay that this method was suitable for prioritization of chemicals for their cytotoxic properties.
In order to categorize chemicals, we used p53 gene-modified mouse ES cells as well as wild-type ES cells.
The p53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor and controls programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cellular senescence that is triggered by DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating agents and radiation.
In the present study, p53-deficient ES cells were found to be more resistant to a tumor initiator, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), than wild-type ES cells, suggesting the inhibition of apoptosis or senescence by a dysfunction in p53.
Chromosome aberrations were more frequently detected in p53-deficient ES cells than in wild-type cells, indicating genomic instability due to the deletion of p53.
Other tumor initiators, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU), did not reveal apparent differences in cytotoxicity between wild-type and p53-deficient ES cells.
Thus, ES test system using gene-modified ES cells may be used to categorize chemicals by detecting their characteristic effects on apoptosis, genotoxic potentials as well as general cytotoxicity.'] 

21245416 MicroRNA expression profile during adipogenic differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the potential to differentiate into any cell type of the three germ layers.
Differentiation processes depend on genetic and epigenetic factors.
The guidance of cell fate determination by microRNAs (miRs) seems important for embryonic development and cell lineage decisions.
MiRs are short, single-stranded, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate through posttranscriptional modulation, a subset of target genes involved in cell differentiation and specific cell function.
We have used microarray profiling of miRs in the mouse embryonic stem cell line CGR8.
Comparison of the miR profiles of undifferentiated stem cells with mesodermal progenitors cells (day 5), preadipocytes (day 10), and adipocytes (day 21) showed that the expression level of 129 miRs changed (twofold) during adipogenic differentiation.
We identified 10 clusters of differentially expressed miRs, which contain putative markers and regulators of mesodermal differentiation and cell fate determination into adipocytes.
Notably, the adipocyte-specific miRs 143 and 103 were upregulated from day 10 onward.
We have therefore demonstrated and characterized the dynamic profile of miR expression during murine adipogenic differentiation in vitro, including the initial differentiation from ESC via mesenchymal progenitors up to adipocytes.
Our findings and experimental approach provide a suitable system to directly interrogate the role of miRs during adipogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells.'] 

24962410 Enhancing effects of serum-rich and cytokine-supplemented culture conditions on developing blastocysts and deriving porcine parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells.
['The present study was conducted to develop an effective method for establishment of porcine parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (ppESCs) from parthenogenetically activated oocyte-derived blastocysts.
The addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the medium on the 3rd day of oocyte culturing improved the development of blastocysts, attachment of inner cell masses (ICMs) onto feeder cells, and formation of primitive ppESC colonies.
ICM attachment was further enhanced by basic fibroblast growth factor, stem cell factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor.
From these attached ICMs, seven ppESC lines were established.
ppESC pluripotency was verified by strong enzymatic alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of pluripotent markers OCT3/4, Nanog, and SSEA4.
Moreover, the ppESCs were induced to form an embryoid body and teratoma.
Differentiation into three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) was confirmed by the expression of specific markers for the layers and histological analysis.
In conclusion, data from the present study suggested that our modified culture conditions using FBS and cytokines are highly useful for improving the generation of pluripotent ppESCs.'] 

26771354 BMP Sustains Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal through Distinct Functions of Different Krüppel-like Factors.
['Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling exerts paradoxical roles in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs); it sustains self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), while it induces differentiation in other PSCs, including human ESCs.
Here, we revisit the roles of BMP-4 using mouse ESCs (mESCs) in naive and primed states.
SMAD1 and SMAD5, which transduce BMP signals, recognize enhancer regions together with KLF4 and KLF5 in naive mESCs.
KLF4 physically interacts with SMAD1 and suppresses its activity.
Consistently, a subpopulation of cells with active BMP-SMAD can be ablated without disturbing the naive state of the culture.
Moreover, Smad1/5 double-knockout mESCs stay in the naive state, indicating that the BMP-SMAD pathway is dispensable for it.
In contrast, the MEK5-ERK5 pathway mediates BMP-4-induced self-renewal of mESCs by inducing Klf2, a critical factor for the ground state pluripotency.
Our study illustrates that BMP exerts its self-renewing effect through distinct functions of different Krüppel-like factors.'] 

24641099 Extracellular vesicles derived from preosteoblasts influence embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into all cell types of the body and, therefore, hold tremendous promise for cell-based regenerative medicine therapies.
One significant challenge that should be addressed before using ESCs in the clinic is to improve methods of efficiently and effectively directing the differentiation of this heterogeneous cell population.
The work presented here examines the potential of harnessing naturally derived extracellular vesicles to deliver genetic material from mature cells to undifferentiated ESCs for the purpose of manipulating stem cell fate.
Vesicles were isolated from preosteoblast cells and were found to be ∼170\u2009nm in diameter and to express the CD40 surface marker.
Multiple interactions were visualized between vesicles and ESCs using confocal microscopy, and no significant difference in cell viability was noted.
Incubation with vesicles caused significant changes in ESC gene expression, including persistence of pluripotent gene levels as well as increased neurectoderm differentiation.
Genetic cargo of the vesicles as well as the cells from which they were derived were examined using a small microRNA (miRNA) gene array.
Interestingly, ∼20% of the examined miRNAs were increased more than twofold in the vesicles compared with preosteoblast cells.
Together, these results suggest that extracellular vesicles may be utilized as a novel method of directing stem cell differentiation.
Future work examining methods for controlled delivery of vesicles may improve the clinical potential of these physiological liposomes for therapeutic applications.'] 

27292615 Chondrogenesis of Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induced by TGFβ1 and BMP7 Through Increased TGFβ Receptor Expression and Endogenous TGFβ1 Production.
[StringElement('For decades stem cells have proven to be invaluable to the study of tissue development.
More recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (ESC-MSCs) have emerged as a cell source with great potential for the future of biomedical research due to their enhanced proliferative capability compared to adult tissue-derived MSCs and effectiveness of musculoskeletal lineage-specific cell differentiation compared to ESCs.
We have previously compared the properties and differentiation potential of ESC-MSCs to bone marrow-derived MSCs.
In this study, we evaluated the potential of TGFβ1 and BMP7 to induce chondrogenic differentiation of ESC-MSCs compared to that of TGFβ1 alone and further investigated the cellular phenotype and intracellular signaling in response to these induction conditions.
Our results showed that the expression of cartilage-associated markers in ESC-MSCs induced by the TGFβ1 and BMP7 combination was increased compared to induction with TGFβ1 alone.
The TGFβ1 and BMP7 combination upregulated the expression of TGFβ receptor and the production of endogenous TGFβs compared to TGFβ1 induction.
The growth factor combination also increasingly activated both of the TGF and BMP signaling pathways, and inhibition of the signaling pathways led to reduced chondrogenesis of ESC-MSCs.
Our findings suggest that by adding BMP7 to TGFβ1-supplemented induction medium, ESC-MSC chondrogenesis is upregulated through increased production of endogenous TGFβ and activities of TGFβ and BMP signaling.

['Human embryonic stem cells can be differentiated in vitro into a wide variety of progeny cells by addition of different morphogens and growth factors.
Our aim was to monitor the expression pattern of tight junction (TJ) components and various cellular markers during differentiation of stem cell lines toward the hepatic lineage.
Human embryonic stem cell lines (HUES1, HUES9) were differentiated into endoderm-like cells, and further differentiated to hepatocyte-like cells.
Gene expressions of Oct3/4, Nanog, alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, cytokeratins (CK-7, CK-8, CK-18, CK-19), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (ABCC2, ABCC7, ABCG2), and various TJ components, including claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-5, claudin-7, and tricellulin, as well as an extracellular matrix component, agrin were monitored during hepatic differentiation by real-time quantitative PCR. The differentiated cells exhibit epithelial morphology and functional assessments similar to that of hepatocytes.
The expression level of stem cell marker genes (Oct3/4 and Nanog) significantly and gradually decreased, while liver-associated genes (alpha-fetoprotein, albumin) reached their highest expression at the end of the differentiation.
The endoderm-like cells expressed claudin-1, which declined eventually.
The expression levels of cholangiocyte markers including claudin-4, CK-7, CK-19, and agrin gradually increased and reached their highest level at the final stage of differentiation.
In contrast, these cells did not express notable level of claudin-7, CK-8 and tricellulin.

['We previously established a method for differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells into α2 integrin-positive odontoblast-like cells.
We also reported that interleukin (IL)-1β induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3-regulated cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in these cells, suggesting that MMP-3 plays a potentially unique physiological role in the regeneration of odontoblast-like cells.
Here, we examined whether up-regulation of MMP-3 activity by IL-1β was mediated by Wnt signaling and led to increased proliferation of odontoblast-like cells.
IL-1β increased mRNA and protein levels of Wnt5a, Wnt5b and the Wnt receptor Lrp5.
Exogenous Wnt5a and Wnt5b were found to increase MMP-3 mRNA, protein and activity, and interestingly the rate of proliferation in these cells.
Treatment with siRNAs against Wnt5a, Wnt5b and Lrp5 suppressed the IL-1β-induced increase in MMP-3 expression and suppressed cell proliferation, an effect rescued by application of exogenous Wnt5.
These results demonstrate the sequential involvement of Wnt5, Lrp5 and MMP-3 in effecting IL-1β-induced proliferation of ES cell-derived odontoblast-like cells.'] 

26458560 Fabrication of uniform-sized poly-ɛ-caprolactone microspheres and their applications in human embryonic stem cell culture.
['The generation of liquefied poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) droplets by means of a microfluidic device results in uniform-sized microspheres, which are validated as microcarriers for human embryonic stem cell culture.
Formed droplet size and size distribution, as well as the resulting PCL microsphere size, are correlated with the viscosity and flow rate ratio of the dispersed (Q d) and continuous (Q c) phases.
PCL in
dichloromethane increases its viscosity with concentration and molecular weight.
Higher viscosity and Q d/Q c lead to the formation of larger droplets, within two observed formation modes: dripping and jetting.
At low viscosity of dispersed phase and Q d/Q c, the microfluidic device is operated in dripping mode, which generates droplets and microspheres with greater size uniformity.
Solutions with lower molecular weight PCL have lower viscosity, resulting in a wider concentration range for the dripping mode.
When coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, the fabricated PCL microspheres are demonstrated capable of supporting the expansion of human embryonic stem cells.']

25720369 Acquiring Ground State Pluripotency: Switching Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells from Serum/LIF Medium to 2i/LIF Medium.
['Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derive from the inner cell mass (ICM) of a blastocyst.
These cells are pluripotent and thus able to generate both somatic and germinal lineages.
It is possible to maintain ESCs in different pluripotent states depending on the in vitro culture conditions.
Classically, ESCs are cultured in the presence of serum and LIF, which sustain the naive state of pluripotency but in this metastable state cells exhibit a large degree of heterogeneity.
In the last few years, it has been discovered that when ESCs are cultured in a chemically defined medium (without serum), in the presence of LIF and with the addition of two small molecules (in particular the inhibitors of MAPK and Gsk-3 pathways), they reach a ground state of pluripotency where cells are more homogeneous and more "ICM-like."

24433831 Progesterone signaling/miR-200a/zeb2 axis regulates self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.
["Progesterone is a steroid hormone and plays an important role during pregnancy.
But the regulation mechanisms of progesterone-progesterone receptor (P4-PR) signaling during pregnancy remain largely unknown.
In this study, we used medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate (MPA) which is a synthetic variant of progesterone and has 20-30 times the activity of progesterone to find that at the same physiological concentration as progesterone during early pregnancy MPA had no significant influence on ES cells self-renewal.
But with the increasing of dosage, MPA can inhibit the self-renewal capacity of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and promote differentiation untimely.
We further determined that MPA can influence the miR-200a/zeb2 pathway by down regulating the level of miR-200a.
miR-200a significantly higher expressed in ES cells to down-regulate the expression of zeb2 to inhibit the self-renewal and promote differentiation of ES cells.
Then we found that the function of MPA can be rescued by over-expression of miR-200a or down-regulation of zeb2.
Our findings revealed the progesterone signaling/miR-200a/zeb2 axis regulating the progesterone signaling to insure the balance of self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells.

24560712 Rationally optimized cryopreservation of multiple mouse embryonic stem cell lines: II--Mathematical prediction and experimental validation of optimal cryopreservation protocols.
['In Part I, we documented differences in cryopreservation success measured by membrane integrity in four mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines from different genetic backgrounds (BALB/c, CBA, FVB, and 129R1), and we demonstrated a potential biophysical basis for these differences through a comparative study characterizing the membrane permeability characteristics and osmotic tolerance limits of each cell line.
Here we use these values to predict optimal cryoprotectants, cooling rates, warming rates, and plunge temperatures.
We subsequently verified these predictions experimentally for their effects on post-thaw recovery.
From this study, we determined that a cryopreservation protocol utilizing 1M propylene glycol, a cooling rate of 1°C/minute, and plunging into liquid nitrogen at -41°C, combined with subsequent warming in a 22°C water bath with agitation, significantly improved post-thaw recovery for three of the four mESC lines, and did not diminish post-thaw recovery for our single exception.
It is proposed that this protocol can be successfully applied to most mESC lines beyond those included within this study once the effect of propylene glycol on mESC gene expression, growth characteristics, and germ-line transmission has been determined.
Mouse ESC lines with poor survival using current standard cryopreservation protocols or our proposed protocol can be optimized on a case-by-case basis using the method we have outlined over two papers.
For our single exception, the CBA cell line, a cooling rate of 5°C/minute in the presence of 1.0M dimethyl sulfoxide or 1.0M propylene glycol, combined with plunge temperature of -80°C was optimal.'] 

24080013 BMP4 is required for the initial expression of MITF in melanocyte precursor differentiation from embryonic stem cells.
['Although the differentiation of melanoblasts to melanocytes is known to depend on many distinct factors, it is still poorly understood which factors lead to the induction of melanoblasts.
To determine which factors might induce melanoblasts, we examined a set of candidate factors for their ability to induce expression of MITF, a master regulator of melanoblast development, in an ES cell-based melanocyte differentiation system.
It appears that BMP4 is capable of inducing MITF expression in stem cells.
In contrast, a number of other factors normally implicated in the development of the melanocyte lineage, including WNT1, WNT3a, SCF, EDN3, IGF1, PDGF, and RA, cannot induce MITF expression.
Nevertheless, BMP4 alone does not allow MITF-expressing precursors to become differentiated melanocytes, but the addition of EDN3 further promotes differentiation of the precursors into mature melanocytes.
Our results support a model in which BMP4 induces MITF expression in pluripotent stem cells and EDN3 subsequently promotes differentiation of these MITF expressing cells along the melanocyte lineage.'] 

26375799 Glutamine contributes to maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal through PKC-dependent downregulation of HDAC1 and DNMT1/3a.
['Although glutamine (Gln) is not an essential amino acid, it is considered a critical substrate in many key metabolic processes that control a variety of physiological functions and are involved in regulating early embryonic development.
Thus, we investigated the effect of Gln on regulation of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal and related signaling pathways.
Gln deprivation decreased Oct4 expression as well as expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins.
However, Gln treatment retained the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and the Oct4 in mESCs, which were blocked by compound 968 (a glutaminase inhibitor).
In addition, Gln stimulated PI3K/Akt pathway, which subsequently elicited PKCϵ translocation to membrane without an influx of intracellular Ca(2+).
Inhibition of Akt and PKC blocked Gln-induced Oct4 expression and proliferation.
Gln also stimulated mTOR phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, which abolished by PKC inhibition.
Furthermore, Gln increased the cellular population of both Oct4 and bromodeoxyuridine positive cells, suggesting that Gln regulates self-renewal ability of mESCs.
Gln induced a decrease in HDAC1, but not in HDAC2, which were blocked by PKC inhibitors.
Gln treatment resulted in an increase in global histone acetylation and methylation.
In addition, Gln significantly reduced methylation of the Oct4 promoter region through decrease in DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression, which were blocked by PKC and HDAC inhibitors.
In conclusion, Gln stimulates mESC proliferation and maintains mESC undifferentiation status through transcription regulation via the Akt, PKCϵ, and mTOR signaling pathways.'] 

25230394 Comparison of the metabolic activation of environmental carcinogens in mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
['We compared mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and fibroblasts (MEFs) for their ability to metabolically activate the environmental carcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) and aristolochic acid I (AAI), measuring DNA adduct formation by (32)P-postlabelling and expression of xenobiotic-metabolism genes by quantitative real-time PCR.
At 2 μM, BaP induced Cyp1a1 expression in MEFs to a much greater extent than in ES cells and formed 45 times more adducts.
Nqo1 mRNA expression was increased by 3-NBA in both cell types but induction was higher in MEFs, as was adduct formation.
For AAI, DNA binding was over 450 times higher in MEFs than in ES cells, although Nqo1 and Cyp1a1 transcriptional levels did not explain this difference.
We found higher global methylation of DNA in ES cells than in MEFs, which suggests higher chromatin density and lower accessibility of the DNA to DNA damaging agents in ES cells.
However, AAI treatment did not alter DNA methylation.
Thus mouse ES cells and MEFs have the metabolic competence to activate a number of environmental carcinogens, but MEFs have lower global DNA methylation and higher metabolic capacity than mouse ES cells.'] 

22751106 Identification of embryonic stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons for engraftment.
['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent a promising source of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons for applications in Parkinson disease.
However, ESC-based transplantation paradigms carry a risk of introducing inappropriate or tumorigenic cells.
Cell purification before transplantation may alleviate these concerns and enable identification of the specific DA neuron stage most suitable for cell therapy.
Here, we used 3 transgenic mouse ESC reporter lines to mark DA neurons at 3 stages of differentiation (early, middle, and late) following induction of differentiation using Hes5::GFP, Nurr1::GFP, and Pitx3::YFP transgenes, respectively.
Transplantation of FACS-purified cells from each line resulted in DA neuron engraftment, with the mid-stage and late-stage neuron grafts being composed almost exclusively of midbrain DA neurons.
Mid-stage neuron cell grafts had the greatest amount of DA neuron survival and robustly induced recovery of motor deficits in hemiparkinsonian mice.
Our data suggest that the Nurr1+ stage (middle stage) of neuronal differentiation is particularly suitable for grafting ESC-derived DA neurons.
Moreover, global transcriptome analysis of progeny from each of the ESC reporter lines revealed expression of known midbrain DA neuron genes and also uncovered previously uncharacterized midbrain genes.
These data demonstrate remarkable fate specificity of ESC-derived DA neurons and outline a sequential stage-specific ESC reporter line paradigm for in vivo gene discovery.'] 

24957598 CstF-64 supports pluripotency and regulates cell cycle progression in embryonic stem cells through histone 3' end processing.
["Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibit a unique cell cycle with a shortened G1 phase that supports their pluripotency, while apparently buffering them against pro-differentiation stimuli.
In ESCs, expression of replication-dependent histones is a main component of this abbreviated G1 phase, although the details of this mechanism are not well understood.
Similarly, the role of 3' end processing in regulation of ESC pluripotency and cell cycle is poorly understood.
To better understand these processes, we examined mouse ESCs that lack the 3' end-processing factor CstF-64.
These ESCs display slower growth, loss of pluripotency and a lengthened G1 phase, correlating with increased polyadenylation of histone mRNAs.
Interestingly, these ESCs also express the τCstF-64 paralog of CstF-64.
However, τCstF-64 only partially compensates for lost CstF-64 function, despite being recruited to the histone mRNA 3' end-processing complex.
Reduction of τCstF-64 in CstF-64-deficient ESCs results in even greater levels of histone mRNA polyadenylation, suggesting that both CstF-64 and τCstF-64 function to inhibit polyadenylation of histone mRNAs.
These results suggest that CstF-64 plays a key role in modulating the cell cycle in ESCs while simultaneously controlling histone mRNA 3' end processing."] 

25713464 NG2+ progenitors derived from embryonic stem cells penetrate glial scar and promote axonal outgrowth into white matter after spinal cord injury.
['The glial scar resulting from spinal cord injury is rich in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), a formidable barrier to axonal regeneration.
We explored the possibility of breaching that barrier by first examining the scar in a functional in vitro model.
We found that embryonic stem cell-derived neural lineage cells (ESNLCs) with prominent expression of nerve glial antigen 2 (NG2) survived, passed through an increasingly inhibitory gradient of CSPG, and expressed matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) at the appropriate stage of their development.
Outgrowth of axons from ESNLCs followed because the migrating cells sculpted pathways in which CSPG was degraded.
The degradative mechanism involved MMP-9 but not MMP-2.
To confirm these results in vivo, we transplanted ESNLCs directly into the cavity of a contused spinal cord 9 days after injury.
A week later, ESNLCs survived and were expressing both NG2 and MMP-9.
Their axons had grown through long distances (>10 mm), although they preferred to traverse white rather than gray matter.
These data are consistent with the concept that expression of inhibitory CSPG within the injury scar is an important impediment to regeneration but that NG2+ progenitors derived from ESNLCs can modify the microenvironment to allow axons to grow through the barrier.
This beneficial action may be partly due to developmental expression of MMP-9.
We conclude that it might eventually be possible to encourage axonal regeneration in the human spinal cord by transplanting ESNLCs or other cells that express NG2.'] 

25907898 Nanotopographical control of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into definitive endoderm.
['Derivation of definitive endoderm (DE) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can address the needs of regenerative medicine for endoderm-derived organs such as the pancreas and liver.
Fibrous substrates which topographically recapitulate native extracellular matrix have been known to promote the stem cell differentiation.
However, the optimal fiber diameter remains to be determined for the desired differentiation.
Here, we have developed a simple method to precisely fabricate electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) fibers with four distinct average diameters at nano- and microscale levels (200, 500, 800, and 1300 nm).
Human ESCs were cultured as clumps or single cells and induced into DE differentiation to determine the optimal topography leading to the promoted differentiation compared with planar culture plates.
Gene expression analysis of the DE-induced cells showed significant upregulation of DE-specific genes exclusively on the 200-nm fibers.
By Western blot analysis, significant expression of DE-specific proteins was found when hESCs were cultured on the 200 nm substrate as single cells rather than clumps, probably due to more efficient cell-matrix interaction realized by morphological observations of the cell colonies.
The results indicated that nanofibrillar substrates, only at ultrathin fiber diameters, provided a better environment for DE differentiation of hESC, which holds great promise in prospective tissue engineering applications.'] 

22155494 Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 immunogloblin promotes neuronal differentiation in the grafts of embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells.
['For safe and efficient transplantation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it is important to reduce inflammatory and immune response by the host brain.
Full activation of T cells in response to donor antigen requires the delivery of two separate but complimentary signals not only via T cell receptor following recognition of antigen, but also via antigen-nonspecific ligation of the costimulatory receptor-ligand pairs such as CD28:CD80/86.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), structurally related to CD28, delivers an inhibitory signal after ligation to CD80/86, resulting in the termination of T cell immune responses.
To investigate the role of this pathway in the survival and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse ESCs, we transplanted the NPCs into mouse brains with or without CTLA4 immunogloblin (CTLA4-Ig).
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that accumulation of inflammatory/immune cells in and around the graft was reduced by CTLA4-Ig.
In contrast, the percentage of neurons in the graft was increased.
These results suggest that CTLA4-Ig may promote neuronal differentiation during the treatment of neurological diseases with cell replacement therapy.'] 

26473351 Quantitative Live Imaging of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Neural Rosettes Reveals Structure-Function Dynamics
Coupled to Cortical Development.
['Neural stem cells (NSCs) are progenitor cells for brain development, where cellular spatial composition (cytoarchitecture) and dynamics are hypothesized to be linked to critical NSC capabilities.
However, understanding cytoarchitectural dynamics of this process has been limited by the difficulty to quantitatively image brain development in vivo.
Here, we study NSC dynamics within Neural Rosettes--highly organized multicellular structures derived from human pluripotent stem cells.
Neural rosettes contain NSCs with strong epithelial polarity and are expected to perform apical-basal interkinetic nuclear migration (INM)--a hallmark of cortical radial glial cell development.
We developed a quantitative live imaging framework to characterize INM dynamics within rosettes.
We first show that the tendency of cells to follow the INM orientation--a phenomenon we referred to as radial organization, is associated with rosette size, presumably via mechanical constraints of the confining structure.
Second, early forming rosettes, which are abundant with founder NSCs and correspond to the early proliferative developing cortex, show fast motions and enhanced radial organization.
In contrast, later derived rosettes, which are characterized by reduced NSC capacity and elevated numbers of differentiated neurons, and thus correspond to neurogenesis mode in the developing cortex, exhibit slower motions and decreased radial organization.
Third, later derived rosettes are characterized by temporal instability in INM measures, in agreement with progressive loss in rosette integrity at later developmental stages.
Finally, molecular perturbations of INM by inhibition of actin or non-muscle myosin-II (NMII) reduced INM measures.
Our framework enables quantification of cytoarchitecture NSC dynamics and may have implications in functional molecular studies, drug screening, and iPS cell-based platforms for disease modeling.'] 

25189518 Enhancement of the propagation of human embryonic stem cells by modifications in the gel architecture of PMEDSAH polymer coatings.
['Well-defined culture conditions are essential for realizing the full potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine where large numbers of cells are required.
Synthetic polymers such as poly[2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide] (PMEDSAH), offer multiple advantages over mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Matrigel™ for hESC culture and expansion.
However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which hESCs are propagated on synthetic polymers coatings.
Here, the effects of PMEDSAH gel architecture on hESC self-renewal were determined.
By increasing the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction time, the thickness of PMEDSAH was increased and its internal hydrogel architecture was modified, while maintaining its overall chemical structure.
A 105\xa0nm thick ATRP PMEDSAH coating showed a significant increase in the expansion rate of hESCs.
Theoretical calculations suggested that 20,000 hESCs cultured on this substrate could be expanded up to 4.7\xa0×\xa010(9) undifferentiated cells in five weeks.
In addition, hESCs grown on ATRP PMEDSAH coatings retained pluripotency and displayed a normal karyotype after long-term culture.
These data demonstrate the importance of polymer physical properties in hESC expansion.
This modification of PMEDSAH coatings may be used to obtain large populations of hESCs required for many applications in regenerative medicine.'] 

24559483 Detecting the developmental toxicity of bFGF in the embryonic stem cell test using differential gene expression of differentiation-related genes.
['Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogenic cytokine that can stimulate mesoderm-and neuroectoderm-originated cell proliferation.
This study was performed to investigate the effects of bFGF on cell differentiation and the expression of specific markers at different embryonic developmental stages.
We firstly evaluated the embryotoxic potential of bFGF in vitro using a modified EST protocol.
Sequentially, we further investigated how bFGF impact the different tissue-special genes and proteins expressions during the differentiation of murine ES cells in vitro and attempt to reveal the effects of bFGF on differentiation processes.
This analysis was focused on key tissue- and stage-specific genes involved in ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal differentiation, including ectodermal-specific gene Nestin, Oligo2 and Syn, mesodermal-specific gene MHC and MyoD, and endodermal-specific gene GATA6, TTR and ALB, as well as undifferentiated gene Sox-2 and Oct-4.
The results demonstrate that bFGF could promote expression of ectodermal-specific genes and protein, but suppress the expressions of endoderm-specific and some mesoderm-specific gene and protein.
A conclusion can be drawn that bFGF exhibits weak embryotoxicity and mainly promotes ES cell differentiation towards the ectodermal lineages but suppress differentiation into endoderm lineages.
These opposing effects of bFGF on the embryonic development of the three germ layers may be related to its weak embryotoxic potential.
More specifically, inhibition of expression of the endodermal-specific markers transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB) by bFGF may be of more value in detecting the embryotoxic potential of bFGF.']

27026076 Essential role of the TFIID subunit TAF4 in murine embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['TAF4 (TATA-binding protein-associated factor 4) and its paralogue TAF4b are components of the TFIID core module.
We inactivated the murine Taf4a gene to address Taf4 function during embryogenesis.
Here we show that Taf4a(-/-) embryos survive until E9.5 where primary germ layers and many embryonic structures are identified showing Taf4 is dispensable for their specification.
In contrast, Taf4 is required for correct patterning of the trunk and anterior structures, ventral morphogenesis and proper heart positioning.
Overlapping expression of Taf4a and Taf4b during embryogenesis suggests their redundancy at early stages.
In agreement with this, Taf4a(-/-) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are viable and comprise Taf4b-containing TFIID.
Nevertheless, Taf4a(-/-) ESCs do not complete differentiation into glutamatergic neurons and cardiomyocytes in vitro due to impaired preinitiation complex formation at the promoters of critical differentiation genes.
We define an essential role of a core TFIID TAF in differentiation events during mammalian embryogenesis.'] 

26365191 Defined MicroRNAs Induce Aspects of Maturation in Mouse and Human Embryonic-Stem-Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.
['Pluripotent-cell-derived cardiomyocytes have great potential for use in research and medicine, but limitations in their maturity currently constrain their usefulness.
Here, we report a method for improving features of maturation in murine and human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (m/hESC-CMs).
We found that coculturing m/hESC-CMs with endothelial cells improves their maturity and upregulates several microRNAs.
Delivering four of these microRNAs, miR-125b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-221, and miR-222 (miR-combo), to m/hESC-CMs resulted in improved sarcomere alignment and calcium handling, a more negative resting membrane potential, and increased expression of cardiomyocyte maturation markers.
Although this could not fully phenocopy all adult cardiomyocyte characteristics, these effects persisted for two months following delivery of miR-combo.
A luciferase assay demonstrated that all four miRNAs target ErbB4, and siRNA knockdown of ErbB4 partially recapitulated the effects of miR-combo.
In summary, a combination of miRNAs induced via endothelial coculture improved ESC-CM maturity, in part through suppression of ErbB4 signaling.'] 

21244227 Ultrastructural characterization of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived oocytes and granulosa cells.
['Germ cells are a unique population of cells responsible for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next.
Our understanding of the key mechanisms underlying germ cell development in vivo remains scarce because of insufficient amounts of cell materials available for conducting biological studies.
The establishment of in vitro differentiation models that support the generation of germ cells from mouse pluripotent stem cells provides an alternative means for studying reproductive development.
The detection and analysis of stem cell-derived germ cells, however, present technical challenges.
Methods for determining the developmental stage of germ cells ex vivo, such as gene expression and/or immunochemical analyses are inadequate, frequently necessitating the use of alternative, elaborate methods to prove germ cell identity.
We have generated putative oocytes and granulosa cells in vitro from mouse embryonic stem cells and utilized electron microscopy to characterize these cells.
Here, we report on the striking ultrastructural similarity of in vitro-generated oocytes and granulosa cells to in vivo oocytes developing within follicles.']

However, this option is limited by the scarcity of tissues, ethical problem, and tumorigenicity.
Nanotechnology is another promising therapy that can be used to mimic the extracellular matrix, label the implanted cells, and also can be applied in the tissue engineering.

26483458 Erk signaling is indispensable for genomic stability and self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.
['Inhibition of Mek/Erk signaling by pharmacological Mek inhibitors promotes self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Intriguingly, Erk signaling is essential for human ESC self-renewal.
Here we demonstrate that Erk signaling is critical for mouse ESC self-renewal and genomic stability.
Erk-depleted ESCs cannot be maintained.
Lack of Erk leads to rapid telomere shortening and genomic instability, in association with misregulated expression of pluripotency genes, reduced cell proliferation, G1 cell-cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis.
Erk signaling is also required for the activation of differentiation genes but not for the repression of pluripotency genes during ESC differentiation.
Furthermore, we find an Erk-independent function of Mek, which may explain the diverse effects of Mek inhibition and Erk knockout on ESC self-renewal.
Together, in contrast to the prevailing view, Erk signaling is required for telomere maintenance, genomic stability, and self-renewal of mouse ESCs.'] 

25242323 H3K36 histone methyltransferase Setd2 is required for murine embryonic stem cell differentiation toward endoderm.
['Setd2 is known as a histone-H3K36-specific methyltransferase.
However, its role in physiological function remains unclear.
In this study, we show that Setd2 mainly regulates differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) toward primitive endoderm.
Furthermore, we show that downregulated endoderm-related genes in Setd2(-/-)
mESCs are associated with an aberrantly low level of Erk activity and that enforced expression of Fgfr3 can rescue the defective Erk pathway in Setd2(-/-) mESCs.
Interestingly, the transcriptional initiation of Fgfr3 is directly regulated through histone H3K36me3 modification in its distal promoter region by Setd2.
These results indicate that Setd2 controls the primitive endoderm differentiation of mESCs by regulating the Fgfr3-Erk signaling.'] 

26265008 Integrative genomics positions MKRN1 as a novel ribonucleoprotein within the embryonic stem cell gene regulatory network.
['In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs) coordinate gene expression to maintain ESC identity; however, the complete repertoire of factors regulating the ESC state is not fully understood.
Our previous temporal microarray analysis of ESC commitment identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein Makorin-1 (MKRN1) as a potential novel component of the ESC GRN.
Here, using multilayered systems-level analyses, we compiled a MKRN1-centered interactome in undifferentiated ESCs at the proteomic and ribonomic level.
Proteomic analyses in undifferentiated ESCs revealed that MKRN1 associates with RNA-binding proteins, and ensuing RIP-chip analysis determined that MKRN1 associates with mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins including proteins that function during cellular stress.
Subsequent biological validation identified MKRN1 as a novel stress granule-resident protein, although MKRN1 is not required for stress granule formation, or survival of unstressed ESCs.
Thus, our unbiased systems-level analyses support a role for the E3 ligase MKRN1 as a ribonucleoprotein within the ESC GRN.'] 

24480567 Hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells on microcarriers.
['Translation of stem cell research to industrial and clinical settings mostly requires large quantities of cells, especially those involving large organs such as the liver.
A scalable reactor system is desirable to ensure a reliable supply of sufficient quantities of differentiated cells.
To increase the culture efficiency in bioreactor system, high surface to volume ratio needs to be achieved.
We employed a microcarrier culture system for the expansion of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as for directed differentiation of these cells to hepatocyte-like cells.
Cells in single cell suspension were attached to the bead surface in even distribution and were expanded to 1×10(6)cells/ml within 2 days of hESC culture with maintenance of the level of pluripotency markers.
Directed differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells on microcarriers, both in static culture and stirred bioreactors, induced similar levels of hepatocyte-like cell differentiation as observed with cells cultured in conventional tissue culture plates.
The cells expressed both immature and mature hepatocyte-lineage genes and proteins such as asialoglycoprotein receptor-1 (ASGPR-1) and albumin.
Differentiated cells exhibited functional characteristics such as secretion of albumin and urea, and CYP3A4 activity could be detected.
Microcarriers thus offer the potential for large-scale expansion and differentiation of hESCs induced hepatocyte-like cells in a more controllable bioreactor environment.'] 

22673034 Evaluation of human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells for detection of CYP1A inducers.
['There is a great deal of interest in differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into hepatocyte-like cells for application in pharmaceutical screening.
Cytochrome P450
(CYP) 1A is involved in the metabolic activation of procarcinogenic compounds as well as in detoxification of drugs.
We differentiated hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells (hESC-derived hepatocyte-like cells) and examined whether CYP1A was induced in these cells by typical inducers of CYP1A. hESC-derived hepatocyte-like cells expressed albumin, α-fetoprotein, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 mRNA.
The levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and UGT1A1 mRNA expression were increased by omeprazole and 3-methylcholanthrene.
Furthermore, the enzyme activity of CYP1A was also increased by these compounds.
In conclusion, hESC-derived hepatocyte-like cells are available for the detection of CYP1A inducers.'] 

22558203 Analysis of regulatory network involved in mechanical induction of embryonic stem cell differentiation.
['Embryonic stem cells are conventionally differentiated by modulating specific growth factors in the cell culture media.
Recently the effect of cellular mechanical microenvironment in inducing phenotype specific differentiation has attracted considerable attention.
We have shown the possibility of inducing endoderm differentiation by culturing the stem cells on fibrin substrates of specific stiffness.
Here, we analyze the regulatory network involved in such mechanically induced endoderm differentiation under two different experimental configurations of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional culture, respectively.
Mouse embryonic stem cells are differentiated on an array of substrates of varying mechanical properties and analyzed for relevant endoderm markers.
The experimental data set is further analyzed for identification of co-regulated transcription factors across different substrate conditions using the technique of bi-clustering.
Overlapped bi-clusters are identified following an optimization formulation, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm.
While typically such analysis is performed at the mean value of expression data across experimental repeats, the variability of stem cell systems reduces the confidence on such analysis of mean data.
Bootstrapping technique is thus integrated with the bi-clustering algorithm to determine sets of robust bi-clusters, which is found to differ significantly from corresponding bi-clusters at the mean data value.
Analysis of robust bi-clusters reveals an overall similar network interaction as has been reported for chemically induced endoderm or endodermal organs but with differences in patterning between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional culture.
Such analysis sheds light on the pathway of stem cell differentiation indicating the prospect of the two culture configurations for further maturation.'] 

26159105 The effect of Young's modulus on the neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.
["There is substantial evidence that cells produce a diverse response to changes in ECM stiffness depending on their identity.
Our aim was to understand how stiffness impacts neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC's), and how this varies at three specific stages of the differentiation process.
In this investigation, three effects of stiffness on cells were considered; attachment, expansion and phenotypic changes during differentiation.
Stiffness was varied from 2 kPa to 18 kPa to finally 35 kPa.
Attachment was found to decrease with increasing stiffness for both ESC's (with a 95% decrease on 35 kPa compared to 2 kPa) and neural precursors (with a 83% decrease on 35 kPa).
The attachment of immature neurons was unaffected by stiffness.
Expansion was independent of stiffness for all cell types, implying that the proliferation of cells during this differentiation process was independent of Young's modulus.
Stiffness had no effect upon phenotypic changes during differentiation for mESC's and neural precursors. 2 kPa increased the proportion of cells that differentiated from immature into mature neurons.
Taken together our findings imply that the impact of Young's modulus on attachment diminishes as neuronal cells become more mature.
Conversely, the impact of Young's modulus on changes in phenotype increased as cells became more mature."] 

26325469 PRDM14 maintains pluripotency of embryonic stem cells through TET-mediated active DNA demethylation.
['Pluripotency and self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depend on a network of transcription factors maintained by exogenous leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF).
PR-domain containing transcriptional regulator 14 (PRDM14), is essential for maintenance of ESC self-renewal when the cells are cultured in serum plus LIF, but not in 2i medium plus LIF.
Here, we show that pluripotency of ESCs is maintained by enforced expression of PRDM14 at a high level, as observed in ESCs in 2i plus LIF and developing primordial germ cells in the absence of LIF. Constitutive expression of PRDM14 represses de novo DNA methylation in pluripotency-associated genes, resulting in the maintenance of gene expression after withdrawal of LIF, while also repressing the upregulation of differentiation markers.
Further, knockdown of Tet1/Tet2 and administration of base excision repair (BER) pathway inhibitors impairs the PRDM14-induced resistance of ESCs to differentiation.
We conclude that, in the absence of LIF, PRDM14 governs the retention of pluripotency-associated genes through the regulation of TET functions in the BER-mediated active demethylation pathway, while acting to exert TET-independent transcriptional repressive activity of several differentiation markers.']
