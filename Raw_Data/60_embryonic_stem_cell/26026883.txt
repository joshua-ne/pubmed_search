26026883 Maximizing Clonal Embryonic Stem Cell Derivation by ERK Pathway Inhibition. ['Since the development of inhibitor-based defined culture conditions (known as "2i"), multiple clonal embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines can be readily derived from single cells isolated directly from mouse embryos. In addition to providing an efficient means to generate ES cells from compound transgenic or murine disease models on any genetic background, this technology can be used to investigate the process of ESC derivation at both a functional and molecular level. Here, we provide details of the procedure for both maximizing the number of cells in the donor tissue and subsequent effective derivation of multiple clonal ES cell lines.']
