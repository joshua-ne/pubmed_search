24934406 Embryonic stem cells improve skeletal muscle recovery after extreme atrophy in mice. [StringElement('We injected embryonic stem cells into mouse tibialis anterior muscles subjected to botulinum toxin injections as a model for reversible neurogenic atrophy.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'BACKGROUND', 'Label': 'INTRODUCTION'}), StringElement('Muscles were exposed to botulinum toxin for 4 weeks and allowed to recover for up to 6 weeks. At the onset of recovery, a single muscle injection of embryonic stem cells was administered. The myofiber cross-sectional area, single twitch force, peak tetanic force, time-to-peak force, and half-relaxation time were determined.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'METHODS', 'Label': 'METHODS'}), StringElement('Although the stem cell injection did not affect the myofiber cross-sectional area gain in recovering muscles, most functional parameters improved significantly compared with those of recovering muscles that did not receive the stem cell injection.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'RESULTS', 'Label': 'RESULTS'}), StringElement('Muscle function recovery was accelerated by embryonic stem cell delivery in this durable neurogenic atrophy model. We conclude that stem cells should be considered a potential therapeutic tool for recovery after extreme skeletal muscle atrophy.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS', 'Label': 'CONCLUSIONS'})]
