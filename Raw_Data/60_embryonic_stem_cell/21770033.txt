21770033 Temporal proteomic profiling of embryonic stem cell secretome during cardiac and neural differentiation. ['During recent years, increased efforts have focused on elucidating the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. Differentiation towards the different lineages has attracted significant attention given the potential use of stem cells in regenerative medicine. Embryonic stem cell differentiation is a complex process coordinated by strictly regulated extracellular signals that act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Through secreted molecules, stem cells affect local niche biology and influence the cross-talking with the surrounding tissues. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that fundamental cell functions, including proliferation and differentiation, are strictly regulated by the complex set of molecules secreted from cells. The understanding of this molecular language could largely increase our knowledge on pathways regulating stem cell differentiation. Here, we have used a proteomics platform to investigate the profile of proteins secreted during differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells. We have followed the dynamics of protein secretion by comparing the secretomes at different time points of murine embryonic stem cell cardiac and neural differentiation. In addition to previously reported molecules, we have identified many secreted proteins not described so far as released from embryonic stem cells nor shown to be differentially released during the process of cardiomyogenesis and neurogenesis.']
