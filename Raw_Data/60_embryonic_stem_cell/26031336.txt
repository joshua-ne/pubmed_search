26031336 Pluripotency and Epigenetic Factors in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Fate Regulation. ['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are characterized by their ability to self-renew and to differentiate into all cell types of a given organism. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the ESC state is of great interest not only for basic research-for instance, ESCs represent a perfect system to study cellular differentiation in vitro-but also for their potential implications in human health, as these mechanisms are likewise involved in cancer progression and could be exploited in regenerative medicine. In this minireview, we focus on the latest insights into the molecular mechanisms mediated by the pluripotency factors as well as their roles during differentiation. We also discuss recent advances in understanding the function of the epigenetic regulators, Polycomb and MLL complexes, in ESC biology.']
