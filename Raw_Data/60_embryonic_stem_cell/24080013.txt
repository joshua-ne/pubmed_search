24080013 BMP4 is required for the initial expression of MITF in melanocyte precursor differentiation from embryonic stem cells. ['Although the differentiation of melanoblasts to melanocytes is known to depend on many distinct factors, it is still poorly understood which factors lead to the induction of melanoblasts. To determine which factors might induce melanoblasts, we examined a set of candidate factors for their ability to induce expression of MITF, a master regulator of melanoblast development, in an ES cell-based melanocyte differentiation system. It appears that BMP4 is capable of inducing MITF expression in stem cells. In contrast, a number of other factors normally implicated in the development of the melanocyte lineage, including WNT1, WNT3a, SCF, EDN3, IGF1, PDGF, and RA, cannot induce MITF expression. Nevertheless, BMP4 alone does not allow MITF-expressing precursors to become differentiated melanocytes, but the addition of EDN3 further promotes differentiation of the precursors into mature melanocytes. Our results support a model in which BMP4 induces MITF expression in pluripotent stem cells and EDN3 subsequently promotes differentiation of these MITF expressing cells along the melanocyte lineage.']
