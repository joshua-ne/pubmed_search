24661257 In vitro generation of motor neuron precursors from mouse embryonic stem cells using mesoporous nanoparticles. [StringElement('Stem cell-derived motor neurons (MNs) are utilized to develop replacement strategies for spinal cord disorders. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells into MN precursors involves factors and their repeated administration. We investigated if delivery of factors loaded into mesoporous nanoparticles could be effective for stem cell differentiation in vitro.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE', 'Label': 'AIM'}), StringElement('We used a mouse embryonic stem cell line expressing green fluorescent protein under the promoter for the MN-specific gene Hb9 to visualize the level of MN differentiation. The differentiation of stem cells was evaluated by expression of MN-specific transcription factors monitored by quantitative real-time PCR reactions and immunocytochemistry.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'METHODS', 'Label': 'MATERIALS & METHODS'}), StringElement('Mesoporous nanoparticles have strong affiliation to the embryoid bodies, penetrate inside the embryoid bodies and come in contact with differentiating cells.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'RESULTS', 'Label': 'RESULTS'}), StringElement('Repeated administration of soluble factors into a culture medium can be avoided due to a sustained release effect using mesoporous silica.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS', 'Label': 'CONCLUSION'})]
