26302750 Association analysis between the distributions of histone modifications and gene expression in the human embryonic stem cell. ['It is well known that histone modifications are associated with gene expression. In order to further study this relationship, 16 kinds of Chip-seq histone modification data and mRNA-seq data of the human embryonic stem cell H1 are chosen. The distributions of histone modifications in the regions flanking transcription start sites (TSSs) for highly expressed and lowly expressed genes are computed, respectively. And four types of distributions of histone modifications in regions flanking TSSs and the spatial patterning of the correlations between histone modifications and gene expression are detected. Our results suggest that the correlations between the regions overlapped by peaks are higher than the non-overlapped ones for each histone modification. In addition, to obtain the effect of the cooperative action of histone modification on gene expression, five histone modification clusters are found in highly expressed and lowly expressed genes, histone modification and gene expression interaction network is constructed. To further explore which region is the main target region for the specific histone modification, the human genes are divided into five functional regions. The results indicate that histone modifications are mostly located in the promoters of highly expressed genes versus the exons of lowly expressed genes, and exons have a smaller range of normalized tag counts than other gene elements in the two groups of genes. Finally, the type specificity and regional bias of histone modifications for 11 key transcription factor genes regulating the stem cell renewal are analyzed.']
