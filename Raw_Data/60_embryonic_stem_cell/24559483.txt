24559483 Detecting the developmental toxicity of bFGF in the embryonic stem cell test using differential gene expression of differentiation-related genes. ['Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogenic cytokine that can stimulate mesoderm-and neuroectoderm-originated cell proliferation. This study was performed to investigate the effects of bFGF on cell differentiation and the expression of specific markers at different embryonic developmental stages. We firstly evaluated the embryotoxic potential of bFGF in vitro using a modified EST protocol. Sequentially, we further investigated how bFGF impact the different tissue-special genes and proteins expressions during the differentiation of murine ES cells in vitro and attempt to reveal the effects of bFGF on differentiation processes. This analysis was focused on key tissue- and stage-specific genes involved in ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal differentiation, including ectodermal-specific gene Nestin, Oligo2 and Syn, mesodermal-specific gene MHC and MyoD, and endodermal-specific gene GATA6, TTR and ALB, as well as undifferentiated gene Sox-2 and Oct-4. The results demonstrate that bFGF could promote expression of ectodermal-specific genes and protein, but suppress the expressions of endoderm-specific and some mesoderm-specific gene and protein. A conclusion can be drawn that bFGF exhibits weak embryotoxicity and mainly promotes ES cell differentiation towards the ectodermal lineages but suppress differentiation into endoderm lineages. These opposing effects of bFGF on the embryonic development of the three germ layers may be related to its weak embryotoxic potential. More specifically, inhibition of expression of the endodermal-specific markers transthyretin (TTR), and albumin (ALB) by bFGF may be of more value in detecting the embryotoxic potential of bFGF.']
