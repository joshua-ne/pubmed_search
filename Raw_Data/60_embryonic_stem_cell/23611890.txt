23611890 In situ electrochemical detection of embryonic stem cell differentiation. ['Stem cell sensors have emerged as a promising technique to electrochemically monitor the functional status and viability of stem cells. However, efficient electrochemical analysis techniques are required for the development of effective electrochemical stem cell sensors. In the current study, we report a newly developed electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) system to determine the status of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. 1-Naphthly phosphate (1-NP), which was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase into a 1-naphthol on an undifferentiated mouse ES cell, was used as a substrate to electrochemically monitor the differentiation status of mouse ES cells. The peak current in the cyclic voltammetry of 1-NP increased linearly with the concentration of pure 1-NP (R(2)=0.9623). On the other hand, the peak current in the electrochemical responses of 1-NP decreased as the number of undifferentiated ES cells increased. The increased dephosphorylation of 1-NP to 1-naphthol made a decreased electrochemical signal. Non-toxicity of 1-NP was confirmed. In conclusion, the proposed electrochemical analysis system can be applied to an electrical stem cell chip for diagnosis, drug detection and on-site monitoring.']
