The spheroids derived from embryonic stem cells (VAL3), but not from several other cell lines studied, possessed a blastocoel-like cavity. BAP-EB expressed several markers of trophectoderm of human blastocysts on Day 2 of induced differentiation. In the subsequent days of differentiation, the cells of the spheroids differentiated into trophoblast-like cells expressing trophoblastic markers, though at levels lower than that in the primary trophoblasts or in a choriocarcinoma cell line. On Day 3 of induced differentiation, BAP-EB selectively attached onto endometrial epithelial cells, but not other non-endometrial cell lines or an endometrial cell line that had lost its epithelial character. The attachment rates of BAP-EB was significantly higher on primary endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) taken from 7 days after hCG induction of ovulation (hCG+7 day) when compared with that from hCG+2 day.
