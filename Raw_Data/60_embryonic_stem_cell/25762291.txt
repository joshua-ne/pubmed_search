25762291 Generation of Embryonic Stem Cells in Rabbits. ['Here we have described a procedure to generate embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines from rabbit preimplantation blastocysts. We have also provided detailed procedures to characterize the resulting ESC lines, such as the analysis of pluripotency marker expression by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunolabeling, and fluorescence-associated cell sorting; evaluation of pluripotency by teratoma production; and assessment of genetic stability by karyotyping.']
