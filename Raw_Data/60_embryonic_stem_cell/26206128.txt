26206128 Gene-modified embryonic stem cell test to characterize chemical risks. ['A high-throughput test of cell growth inhibition was performed using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to assess chemical toxicities. We herein demonstrated using a 96-well culture plate approach and the MTT assay that this method was suitable for prioritization of chemicals for their cytotoxic properties. In order to categorize chemicals, we used p53 gene-modified mouse ES cells as well as wild-type ES cells. The p53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor and controls programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cellular senescence that is triggered by DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating agents and radiation. In the present study, p53-deficient ES cells were found to be more resistant to a tumor initiator, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), than wild-type ES cells, suggesting the inhibition of apoptosis or senescence by a dysfunction in p53. Chromosome aberrations were more frequently detected in p53-deficient ES cells than in wild-type cells, indicating genomic instability due to the deletion of p53. Other tumor initiators, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU), did not reveal apparent differences in cytotoxicity between wild-type and p53-deficient ES cells. Thus, ES test system using gene-modified ES cells may be used to categorize chemicals by detecting their characteristic effects on apoptosis, genotoxic potentials as well as general cytotoxicity.']
