24881868 Self-renewal and cell lineage differentiation strategies in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. [StringElement('Since the initial discoveries of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, many strategies have been developed to utilize the potential of these cells for translational research and disease modeling. The success of these aims and the development of future applications in this area will depend on the ability to generate high-quality and large numbers of differentiated cell types that genetically, epigenetically, and functionally mimic the cells found in the body.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'BACKGROUND', 'Label': 'INTRODUCTION'}), StringElement('In this review, we highlight the current strategies used to maintain stem cell pluripotency (a measure of stem cell quality), as well as provide an overview of the various differentiation strategies being used to generate cells from all three germ lineages. We also discuss the particular considerations that must be addressed when utilizing these cells for translational therapy, and provide an example of a cell type currently used in clinical trials.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'METHODS', 'Label': 'AREAS COVERED'}), StringElement('The major challenge in regenerative medicine and disease modeling will be in generating functional cells of sufficient quality that are physiologically and epigenetically similar to the diverse cells that they are modeled after. By meeting these criteria, these differentiated products can be successfully used in disease modeling, drug/toxicology screens, and cellular replacement therapy.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS', 'Label': 'EXPERT OPINION'})]
