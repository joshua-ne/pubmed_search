26292329 Transition toward Human Cytomegalovirus Susceptibility in Early Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Neural Precursors. ['Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities. To dissect the earliest events of infection in the developing human brain, we studied HCMV infection during controlled differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into neural precursors. We traced a transition from viral restriction in hESC, mediated by a block in viral binding, toward HCMV susceptibility in early hESC-derived neural precursors. We further revealed the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRÎ±) as a determinant of the developmentally acquired HCMV susceptibility.']
