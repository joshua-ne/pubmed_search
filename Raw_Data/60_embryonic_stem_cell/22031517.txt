22031517 Craniopharyngiomas express embryonic stem cell markers (SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, and SOX9) as pituitary stem cells but do not coexpress RET/GFRA3 receptors. [StringElement('Adult stem cells maintain some markers expressed by embryonic stem cells and express other specific markers depending on the organ where they reside.

CRF maintain the expression of SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, SOX9, and β-catenin. However, RET and GFRA3 expression was altered in CRF. In 25% (five of 20), both RET and GFRA3 were detected but not colocalized in the same cells.

CRF share the stem cell markers suggesting a common origin with GPS.
