23863198 Non-canonical activity of retinoic acid in epigenetic control of embryonic stem cell. ["Non-canonical cytoplasmic activities and signal transduction of retinoic acid (RA) expand RA's pleiotropic effects in coordinating the epigenome in embryonic stem cell (ESC). Examples include RA-bound cellular retinoic acid binding protein I, which activates ERK2. By engaging both cytosolic and nuclear mediators, RA can efficiently augment ESC's epigenome."]
