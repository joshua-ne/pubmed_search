24615935 Ginsenosides may enhance the functionality of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro. ['Various chemicals have been reported to induce the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiomyocytes (CMs), however, their contributions to the functionality of hESC-derived CMs are still limited. In this study, we evaluated the effects of red ginseng extract (RGE), ginsenoside-Rb1 (gRb1, panaxadiol), and ginsenoside-Re (gRe, panaxatriol) on the differentiation of hESCs and the functionality of derived CMs. Undifferentiated hESCs were treated with 0.25 mg/mL RGE, 10 μmol/L gRb1, or 10 μmol/L gRe for 48 hours at the differentiation induction (early stage) or maturation (late stage) period. The expression of mesodermal and cardiac transcription factor genes was upregulated in the ginsenoside-treated groups from early stage. The expression of cardiac sarcomeric genes was significantly upregulated at the late stage. The gRb1- and gRe-treated groups upregulated the expression of potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1 (KCNE1) and the gRe-treated group showed a longer beating duration compared to the control. Taken together, ginsenosides may enhance the functionality of hESC-derived CMs in vitro.']
