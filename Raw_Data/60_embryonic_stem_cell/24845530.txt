24845530 Noninvasive reporter gene imaging of human Oct4 (pluripotency) dynamics during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells in living subjects. [StringElement('Human pluripotency gene networks (PGNs), controlled in part by Oct4, are central to understanding pluripotent stem cells, but current fluorescent reporter genes (RGs) preclude noninvasive assessment of Oct4 dynamics in living subjects.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE', 'Label': 'PURPOSE'}), StringElement('To assess Oc4 activity noninvasively, we engineered a mouse embryonic stem cell line which encoded both a pOct4-hrluc (humanized renilla luciferase) reporter and a pUbi-hfluc2-gfp (humanized firefly luciferase 2 fused to green fluorescent protein) reporter.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'METHODS', 'Label': 'PROCEDURES'}), StringElement('In cell culture, pOct4-hRLUC activity demonstrated a peak at 48 h (day 2) and significant downregulation by 72 h (day 3) (p=0.0001).
