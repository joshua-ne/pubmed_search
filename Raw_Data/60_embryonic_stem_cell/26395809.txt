26395809 Cardiomyogenesis of embryonic stem cells upon purinergic receptor activation by ADP and ATP. ["Purinergic signaling may be involved in embryonic development of the heart. In the present study, the effects of purinergic receptor stimulation on cardiomyogenesis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were investigated. ADP or ATP increased the number of cardiac clusters and cardiac cells, as well as beating frequency. Cardiac-specific genes showed enhanced expression of α-MHC, MLC2v, α-actinin, connexin 45 (Cx45), and HCN4, on both gene and protein levels upon ADP/ATP treatment, indicating increased cardiomyogenesis and pacemaker cell differentiation. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of purinergic receptor expression demonstrated presence of P2X1, P2X4, P2X6, P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 on differentiating ES cells. ATP and ADP as well as the P2X agonists β,γ-methylenadenosine 5'-triphosphate (β,γ-MetATP) and 8-bromoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-Br-ATP) but not UTP or UDP transiently increased the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) as evaluated by the calcium indicator Fluo-4, whereas no changes in membrane potential were observed. [Ca(2+)](i) transients induced by ADP/ATP were abolished by the phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) inhibitor U-73122, suggesting involvement of metabotropic P2Y receptors. Furthermore, partial inhibition of [Ca(2+)](i) transients was achieved in presence of MRS2179, a selective P2Y1 receptor antagonist, whereas PPADS, a non-selective P2 receptor inhibitor, completely abolished the [Ca(2+)](i) response. Consequently, cardiomyocyte differentiation was decreased upon long term co-incubation of cells with ADP and P2 receptor antagonists. In summary, activation of purinoceptors and the subsequent [Ca(2+)](i) transients enhance the differentiation of ES cells toward cardiomyocytes. Purinergic receptor stimulation may be a promising strategy to drive the fate of pluripotent ES cells into a particular population of cardiomyocytes."]
