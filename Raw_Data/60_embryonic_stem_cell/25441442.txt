25441442 Gene dynamics of core transcription factors for pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. ['Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is maintained by core transcription factors (TFs). Although the expression of these TFs is well documented, their expression dynamics is poorly evaluated. Here, we visualized the dynamics of Nanog and Oct3/4 expression in ESC using fluorescent reporters and found that expression of these TFs change dramatically during culture.']
