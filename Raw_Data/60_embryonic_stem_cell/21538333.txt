21538333 Microprinted feeder cells guide embryonic stem cell fate. ['We introduce a non-contact approach to microprint multiple types of feeder cells in a microarray format using immiscible aqueous solutions of two biopolymers. Droplets of cell suspension in the denser aqueous phase are printed on a substrate residing within a bath of the immersion aqueous phase. Due to their affinity to the denser phase, cells remain localized within the drops and adhere to regions of the substrate underneath the drops. We show the utility of this technology for creating duplex heterocellular stem cell niches by printing two different support cell types on a gel surface and overlaying them with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). As desired, the type of printed support cell spatially direct the fate of overlaid mESCs. Interestingly, we found that interspaced mESCs colonies on differentiation-inducing feeder cells show enhanced neuronal differentiation and give rise to dense networks of neurons. This cell printing technology provides unprecedented capabilities to efficiently identify the role of various feeder cells in guiding the fate of stem cells.']
