24480567 Hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells on microcarriers. ['Translation of stem cell research to industrial and clinical settings mostly requires large quantities of cells, especially those involving large organs such as the liver. A scalable reactor system is desirable to ensure a reliable supply of sufficient quantities of differentiated cells. To increase the culture efficiency in bioreactor system, high surface to volume ratio needs to be achieved. We employed a microcarrier culture system for the expansion of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as for directed differentiation of these cells to hepatocyte-like cells. Cells in single cell suspension were attached to the bead surface in even distribution and were expanded to 1Ã—10(6)cells/ml within 2 days of hESC culture with maintenance of the level of pluripotency markers. Directed differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells on microcarriers, both in static culture and stirred bioreactors, induced similar levels of hepatocyte-like cell differentiation as observed with cells cultured in conventional tissue culture plates. The cells expressed both immature and mature hepatocyte-lineage genes and proteins such as asialoglycoprotein receptor-1 (ASGPR-1) and albumin. Differentiated cells exhibited functional characteristics such as secretion of albumin and urea, and CYP3A4 activity could be detected. Microcarriers thus offer the potential for large-scale expansion and differentiation of hESCs induced hepatocyte-like cells in a more controllable bioreactor environment.']
