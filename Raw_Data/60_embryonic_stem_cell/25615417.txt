25615417 Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for identification of correctly targeted murine embryonic stem cell clones. ['Following locus-specific genome editing of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the identification of correctly targeted clones remains a challenge. We applied multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for homologous recombination-based genomic integration of a knockout construct in which part of a gene is deleted. All candidate ESCs thereby identified were subsequently validated by conventional methods. Thus, MLPA represents a highly reliable as well as cost- and time-efficient alternative to currently applied methods such as Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches. It is also applicable to knockin recombination strategies and compatible with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and other genome editing strategies.']
