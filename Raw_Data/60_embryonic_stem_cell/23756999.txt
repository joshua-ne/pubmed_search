23756999 Effective induction of cells expressing GABAergic neuronal markers from mouse embryonic stem cell. ['Successful derivations of specific neuronal and glial cells from embryonic stem cells have enormous potential for cell therapies and regenerative medicine. However, the low efficiency, the complexity of induction method, and the need for purification represent obstacles that make their application impractical. In this study, we found that PDGFRα(+) cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) can serve as a useful source from which to induce cells that express γ-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)-releasing (GABAergic) neuronal markers. PDGFRα(+) cells were induced from mESC on collagen IV-coated plates in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture medium with limited exposure to retinoic acid, sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and maintained in MSC culture medium containing Y-27632, a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor. We found that supplementation of vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-basic, and sodium azide (NaN3) to MSC culture medium effectively differentiated PDGFRα(+) cells into cells that express GABAergic neuronal markers, such as Pax2, Dlx2, GAD67 NCAM, and tubulin-βIII, while markers for oligodendrocyte (Sox2) and astrocyte (Glast) were suppressed. Immunostaining for GABA showed the majority (86\u2009±\u20095%) of the induced cells were GABA-positive. We also found that the PDGFRα(+) cells retained such differentiation potential even after more than ten passages and cryopreservation. In summary, this study presents a simple and highly efficient method of inducing cells that express GABAergic neuronal markers from mESC. Together with its ease of maintenance in vitro, PDGFRα(+) cells derived from mESC may serve as a useful source for such purpose.']
