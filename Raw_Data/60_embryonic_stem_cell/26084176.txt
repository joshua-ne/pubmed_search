The experimental results, on one hand, strengthen the knowledge about the influence of the relative compositions of Zuogui pill and Yougui pill on the reproductive differentiation of stem cells, on the other hand, help to explain the mechanism of the treatment of the infertility by Zuogui pill and Yougui pill.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS', 'Label': 'CONCLUSION'})]
