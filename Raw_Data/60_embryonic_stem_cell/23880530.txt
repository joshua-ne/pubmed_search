23880530 Human embryonic stem cell applications for retinal degenerations. ["Loss of vision in severe retinal degenerations often is a result of photoreceptor cell or retinal pigment epithelial cell death or dysfunction. Cell replacement therapy has the potential to restore useful vision for these individuals especially after they have lost most or all of their light-sensing cells in the eye. A reliable, well-characterized source of retinal cells will be needed for replacement purposes. Human embryonic stem cells (ES cells) can provide an unlimited source of replacement retinal cells to take over the function of lost cells in the eye. The author's intent for this review is to provide an historical overview of the field of embryonic stem cells with relation to the retina. The review will provide a quick primer on key pathways involved in the development of the neural retina and RPE followed by a discussion of the various protocols out in the literature for generating these cells from non-human and human embryonic stem cells and end with in vivo application of ES cell-derived photoreceptors and RPE cells."]
