25447493 Detection of embryonic stem cell lysate biomarkers by surface plasmon resonance with reduced nonspecific adsorption. ['Surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) has emerged as a versatile biosensor to detect a wide range of biomolecular interactions with divergent potential applications. However, the use of this advanced-level technology for stem cell lysate study is still not much explored. Cell lysates are significant biological analytes used for disease diagnostics and proteomic studies, but their complex nature limits their use as an analyte for SPRi biosensors. Here, we review the problems associated with the use of SPRi for stem cell lysate study and examine the role of surface chemistry, running buffer, and blocking solution in order to minimize nonspecific adsorption (NSA). We detect the expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Rex1, and Lin28 biomarkers present in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lysate against their corresponding antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface with reduced NSA. The current study shows that the conjunction of SPRi and microarray can be used as a label-free, high-throughput, and rapid technique for detection of biomarkers and their relative abundance in stem cell lysate study.']
