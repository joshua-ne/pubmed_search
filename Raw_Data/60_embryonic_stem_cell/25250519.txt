25250519 Leptin enhances endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis in murine embryonic stem cells. ['The metabolic regulation of leptin and its angiogenic effects have been well characterized in adult mammals. However, the role of leptin in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) has not been characterized. We hypothesized that leptin enhances the generation of ECs derived from ESCs and, in this way, promotes angiogenesis in embryonic vessels. To address this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro model consisting of murine ESCs-derived embryoid bodies (EBs). Vascular density, EC and angiogenesis markers as well as phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) were investigated in leptin-treated EBs and in untreated EBs as controls. ESC-derived ECs were isolated by magnetic sorting based on the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31). Significant upregulation of EC and angiogenic markers as well as higher vessel density were found in leptin-treated EBs compared to controls. CD31 positive enriched cells derived from leptin-treated EBs had improved proliferation and survival rate and showed higher levels of pSTAT3. These results suggested that leptin promotes EC differentiation and angiogenesis in mouse EBs and that janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway can play a role in this biological process. Leptin-mediated EC differentiation and angiogenesis in ESCs can be a useful application towards regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.']
