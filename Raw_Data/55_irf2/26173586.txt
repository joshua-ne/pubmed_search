26173586 MicroRNA-18a modulates P53 expression by targeting IRF2 in gastric cancer patients. [StringElement('MicroRNA-18a (miR-18a) has been reported to be upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared with normal gastric tissues. However, little is known about its prognostic value and biological roles.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE', 'Label': 'BACKGROUND AND AIM'}), StringElement('In this study, miR-18a expression in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues was validated by in situ hybridization, and the predictive values of miR-18a were explored. The biological roles of miR-18a and the underlying signal pathway were investigated in GC cell lines.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'METHODS', 'Label': 'METHODS'}), StringElement("Overexpressed intra-tumoral miR-18a was associated with poor survival rate and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival rate (P < 0.001) in GC patients. Forced expression of miR-18a remarkably enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells, while inhibition of miR-18a caused the opposite effects. Further study showed that miR-18a suppressed the expression of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) by directly binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Moreover, miR-18a expression levels are inversely correlated with IRF2 in human GC tissues. Western blot showed that forced expression of miR-18a could not only downregulate the expression of IRF2, but also inhibit the expression of P53, suggesting that IRF2 might play as a tumor suppressor by regulating P53 signaling in GC.", attributes={'NlmCategory': 'RESULTS', 'Label': 'RESULTS'}), StringElement('miR-18a modulated P53 expression by directly targeting IRF2 and had a high predictive value for prognosis of GAC patients.
