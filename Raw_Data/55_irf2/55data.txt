25285625 Association of functional polymorphisms in interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-control association study. ["Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) negatively regulates type I interferon (IFN) responses, while it plays a role in induction of Th1 differentiation. Previous linkage and association studies in European-American populations suggested genetic role of IRF2 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, this observation has not yet been confirmed. No studies have been reported in the Asian populations. Here we investigated whether IRF2 polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to SLE in a Japanese population. Association study of 46 IRF2 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected association of an intronic SNP, rs13146124, with SLE. When the association was analyzed in 834 Japanese patients with SLE and 817 healthy controls, rs13146124 T was significantly increased in SLE compared with healthy controls (dominant model, P\u200a=\u200a5.4×10(-4), Bonferroni-corrected P [Pc]\u200a=\u200a0.026, odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.85). To find causal SNPs, resequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing. Twelve polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with rs13146124 (r2: 0.30-1.00) were identified, among which significant association was observed for rs66801661 (allele model, P\u200a=\u200a7.7×10(-4), Pc\u200a=\u200a0.037, OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.19-1.96) and rs62339994 (dominant model, P\u200a=\u200a9.0×10(-4), Pc\u200a=\u200a0.043, OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.17-1.82). The haplotype carrying both of the risk alleles (rs66801661A-rs62339994A) was significantly increased in SLE (P\u200a=\u200a9.9×10(-4)), while the haplotype constituted by both of the non-risk alleles (rs66801661G-rs62339994G) was decreased (P\u200a=\u200a0.0020). A reporter assay was carried out to examine the effect of the IRF2 haplotypes on the transcriptional activity, and association of the IRF2 risk haplotype with higher transcriptional activity was detected in Jurkat T cells under IFNγ stimulation (Tukey's test, P\u200a=\u200a1.2×10(-4)). In conclusion, our observations supported the association of IRF2 with susceptibility to SLE, and the risk haplotype was suggested to be associated with transcriptional activation of IRF2."] 
25463511 Ctenopharyngodon idella IRF2 plays an antagonistic role to IRF1 in transcriptional regulation of IFN and ISG genes. ['Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) make up a family of transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in cells. In the present study, an IRF2 gene (termed CiIRF2, JX628585) was cloned and characterized from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The full-length cDNA of CiIRF2 is 1809\u2009bp in length, with the largest open reading frame (ORF) of 981\u2009bp encoding a putative protein of 326 amino acids. CiIRF2 contains a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) in N-terminal and a non-conserved C-terminal region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that CiIRF2 shares significant homology to the known IRF2 counterparts. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed its closer evolutionary relationship with other fish counterparts, especially with zebra fish IRF2. CiIRF2 was ubiquitously expressed at low level in all tested grass carp tissues and significantly up-regulated except in brain following poly I:C 6-12\u2009h post stimulation. In order to understand fish innate immune and resistance to virus diseases, recombinant CiIRF2 with His-tag was over-expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli, and the expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin. Promoter sequences of grass carp type I IFN gene (CiIFN) and two ISG genes (CiPKR and CiPKZ) were amplified and cloned. In vitro, gel mobility shift assays were employed to analyze the interaction of CiIRF2 protein with promoters of CiIFN, CiPKR and CiPKZ respectively. The results showed that CiIRF2 bound to these promoters with high affinity by means of its DBD. Afterwards, recombinant plasmids of pGL3-CiIFN, pGL3-CiPKR and pGL3-CiPKZ were constructed and transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-CiIRF2 or pcDNA3.1-CiIRF1 respectively into C.\u2009idella kidney (CIK) cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that CiIRF2 down-regulates the transcription activity of CiIFN, CiPKR and CiPKZ genes in CIK cells. To further understand the function of fish IRF2, expression plasmids (pcDNA3.1-IRF2 and pcDNA3.1-IRF1) were transiently co-transfected with pGL3-IFN or pGL3-CiPKZ into CIK cells, respectively. The results revealed that CiIRF2 plays an antagonistic role to CiIRF1 in transcriptional regulation of IFN and ISG genes.'] 
22113474 Genetic variants in interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) are associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema herpeticum. ['Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) is a member of a family of transcriptional factors involved in the modulation of IFN-induced immune responses to viral infection. To test whether genetic variants in IRF2 predict risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) and ADEH (atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum), we genotyped 78 IRF2 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both European-American (n = 435) and African-American (n = 339) populations. Significant associations were observed between AD and two SNPs (rs793814, P = 0.007, odds ratio (OR) = 0.52; rs3756094, P = 0.037, OR = 0.66) among European Americans and one SNP (rs3775572, P = 0.016, OR = 0.46) among African Americans. Significant associations were also observed between ADEH and five SNPs (P = 0.049-0.022) among European Americans. The association with ADEH was further strengthened by haplotype analyses, wherein a five-SNP (CAGGA) haplotype showed the strongest association with ADEH (P = 0.0008). Eight IRF2 SNPs were significantly associated with IFN-γ production after herpes simplex virus (HSV) stimulation (P = 0.048-0.0008), including an AD-associated SNP (rs13139310, P = 0.008). Our findings suggest that distinct markers in IRF2 may be associated with AD and ADEH, which may depend upon ethnic ancestry, and genetic variants in IRF2 may contribute to an abnormal immune response to HSV.'] 
25994869 Genetic association of key Th1/Th2 pathway candidate genes, IRF2, IL6, IFNGR2, STAT4 and IL4RA, with atopic asthma in the Indian population. ["Asthma is a complex, multifactorial disease resulting due to dysregulated immune responses. Genetic factors contribute significantly to asthma pathogenesis, and identification of these factors is one of the major goals in understanding the disease. Th1/Th2 helper differentiation has a critical role in modulating the phenotypes associated with atopic asthma. This study was aimed at identifying genetic modifiers of asthma in selected genes involved in T helper differentiation. A total of 354 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 33 candidate genes were genotyped in a case-control cohort (cases=147, controls=199) and families (n=247) using Illumina's Golden Gate Assay. Five SNPs, rs3733475A/C (IRF2), rs2069832A/G (IL6), rs2012075G/A (IFNGR2) and rs1400656G/A (STAT4) and rs1805011C/A (IL4RA) were found to be associated with asthma in family based as well as in case-control analyses (P=0.002, P=0.001, P=0.004, P=0.003 and P=0.001, respectively). Interestingly, the minor alleles at these loci showed a protective effect. A five loci haplotype, TAACG, in IRF2 gene, was significantly associated with asthma in families (P=1.1 × 10(-6)) and in case-control cohort (P=0.01). In conclusion, our studies led to identification of some key candidate genes, namely IRF2, IL6, IFNGR2, STAT4 and IL4RA that modulate genetic susceptibility to asthma in the Indian population. Also, this is the first report of independent association of IL6 gene polymorphism with atopic asthma."] 
18575764 siRNA targeting the IRF2 transcription factor inhibits leukaemic cell growth. ['Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 and its functional antagonist IRF2 were originally discovered as transcription factors that regulate the interferon-beta gene. Control of cell growth has led to the definition of IRF1 as a tumour suppressor gene and IRF2 as an oncogene. Clinically, approximately 70% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia demonstrate dysregulated expression of IRF1 and/or IRF2. Our previous studies have shown that human leukaemic TF-1 cells exhibit abnormally high expression of both IRF1 and IRF2, the latter acting to abrogate IRF1 tumour suppression, making these cells ideal for analysis of down-regulation of IRF2 expression. A novel G418 screening protocol was developed and used for identifying effective siRNA that targets IRF2 (siIRF2). Using optimized siIRF2 in leukaemic TF-1 cells, IRF2 was down-regulated by approximately 70% at both mRNA and protein levels. Phenotypically, this resulted in growth inhibition associated with G2/M arrest as well as induction of polyploidy, differentiation and apoptosis. In contrast to these results, siIRF2 targeting did not affect normal haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell growth. These results indicate the potential utility of IRF2 inhibition as a therapeutic approach to cancer.']

M.\xa0amblycephala irfs share a high sequence homology with other vertebrate irfs. Constitutive expression levels of the three genes were detected (using qPCR) in all studied tissues: low to medium in kidney, gills, heart and muscle, and high in liver, spleen, intestine and blood. qPCR was also used to analyze the dynamic expression patterns of irfs in different embryonic development stages: irf2 is not activated during the embryonic development, whereas irf9 appears to play important roles around hatching and during the larval development. Transcripts of all three studied irfs were upregulated after stimulation by Aeromonas hydrophila bacterium in liver, spleen, head kidney and trunk kidney, whereas downregulation was observed in intestine and gills.

22042864 Characterization of dsRNA-induced pancreatitis model reveals the regulatory role of IFN regulatory factor 2 (Irf2) in trypsinogen5 gene transcription. ['Mice deficient for interferon regulatory factor (Irf)2 (Irf2(-/-) mice) exhibit immunological abnormalities and cannot survive lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. The pancreas of these animals is highly inflamed, a phenotype replicated by treatment with poly(I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA. Trypsinogen5 mRNA was constitutively up-regulated about 1,000-fold in Irf2(-/-) mice compared with controls as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Further knockout of IFNα/β receptor 1(Ifnar1) abolished poly(I:C)-induced pancreatitis but had no effect on the constitutive up-regulation of trypsinogen5 gene, indicating crucial type I IFN signaling to elicit the inflammation. Analysis of Ifnar1(-/-) mice confirmed type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation of dsRNA-sensing pattern recognition receptor genes MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3, which induced poly(I:C)-dependent cell death in acinar cells in the absence of IRF2. We speculate that Trypsin5, the trypsinogen5 gene product, leaking from dead acinar cells triggers a chain reaction leading to lethal pancreatitis in Irf2(-/-) mice because it is resistant to a major endogenous trypsin inhibitor, Spink3.']
