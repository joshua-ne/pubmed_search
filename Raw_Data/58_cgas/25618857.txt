25618857 [The role of chromogranin-A and its derived peptide, WE-14 in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus]. ['Chromogranin-A is a member of the granine protein family. It is produced in neuroendocrine cells via secretory granules. Many cleavage proteins are formed from chromogranin-A, from which some have well known biological activity, while the function of others is not yet fully known. Serum chromogranin-A levels are used in neuroendocrine tumour diagnostics. Recent studies showed that one of its cleavage protein, WE-14 may also play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes. WE-14 may function as an autoantigen for T-cells involved in the destruction of Î²-cells. This mechanism was previously observed only in non-obese diabetic mice. Novel results show that WE-14 also serves as a target for autoreactive cells in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients as well, which reaction can be increased with transglutaminase. In this paper the authors summarize the recent knowledge about chromogranin-A and its potential role in the pathomechanism of type 1 diabetes mellitus.']
