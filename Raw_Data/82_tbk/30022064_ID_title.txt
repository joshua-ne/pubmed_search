TBK-binding protein 1 regulates IL-15-induced autophagy and NKT cell survival. 30022064 Nature communications ['The cytokine IL-15 mediates development and survival of immune cells, including natural killer T (NKT) cells, but the underlying mechanism of IL-15 function is incompletely understood. Here we show that IL-15 induces autophagy in NKT cells with a mechanism that involves a crucial signaling component, TBK-binding protein 1 (Tbkbp1). Tbkbp1 facilitates activation of the autophagy-initiating kinase Ulk1 through antagonizing the inhibitory action of mTORC1. This antagonization involves the recruitment of an mTORC1-opposing phosphatase to Ulk1. Tbkbp1 deficiency attenuates IL-15-stimulated NKT cell autophagy, and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant ROS production, defective Bcl2 expression and reduced NKT cell survival. Consequently, Tbkbp1-deficient mice have profound deficiency in NKT cells, especially IFN-Î³-producing NKT1. We further show that Tbkbp1 regulates IL-15-stimulated autophagy and survival of NK cells. These findings suggest a mechanism of autophagy induction by IL-15, and establish Tbkbp1 as a regulator of NKT cell development and survival.']
