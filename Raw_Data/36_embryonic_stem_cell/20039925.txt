20039925 Currently the full-text not available Chicken embryonic stem cells as a non-mammalian embryonic stem cell model. Development, growth & differentiation ['Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were isolated in the early 1980s from mouse and in the late 1990s from primate and human. These cells present the unique property of self-renewal and the ability to generate differentiated progeny in all embryonic lineages both in vitro and in vivo. The mESCs (mouse embryonic stem cells) can contribute to both somatic and germinal lineages once re-injected into a recipient embryo at the blastocyst stage. In avian species, chicken embryonic stem cells (cESCs) have been isolated from the in vitro culture of early chicken blastodermal cells (cBCs) taken from stage X embryo (EG&K) These cESCs can be maintained under specific culture conditions and have been characterized on the basis of their morphology, biochemical features, in vitro differentiation potentialities and in vivo morphogenetic properties. The relationship between these cESCs and some of the chicken germ cells identified and grown under specific culture conditions are still under debate, in particular with the identification of the Cvh gene as a key factor for germ cell determination. Moreover, by cloning the avian homologue of the Oct4 mammalian gene, we have demonstrated that this gene, as well as the chicken Nanog gene, was involved in the characterization and maintenance of the chicken pluripotency. These first steps toward the understanding of pluripotency control in a non-mammalian species opens the way for the development and characterization of putative new cell types such as chicken EpiSC and raises the question of the existence of reprogramming in avian species. These different points are discussed.']
