The spheroids derived from embryonic stem cells (VAL3), but not from several other cell lines studied, possessed a blastocoel-like cavity. BAP-EB expressed several markers of trophectoderm of human blastocysts on Day 2 of induced differentiation. In the subsequent days of differentiation, the cells of the spheroids differentiated into trophoblast-like cells expressing trophoblastic markers, though at levels lower than that in the primary trophoblasts or in a choriocarcinoma cell line. On Day 3 of induced differentiation, BAP-EB selectively attached onto endometrial epithelial cells, but not other non-endometrial cell lines or an endometrial cell line that had lost its epithelial character. The attachment rates of BAP-EB was significantly higher on primary endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) taken from 7 days after hCG induction of ovulation (hCG+7 day) when compared with that from hCG+2 day. The spheroids also invaded through Ishikawa cells and the primary endometrial stromal cells in the co-culture.', attributes={'Label': 'MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE', 'NlmCategory': 'RESULTS'}), StringElement('The attachment rates of BAP-EB were compared between EEC obtained from Day 2 and Day 7 of the gonadotrophin stimulated cycle, but not the natural cycles.', attributes={'Label': 'LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION', 'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS'}), StringElement('BAP-EB have the potential to be used as a test for predicting endometrial receptivity in IVF cycles and provide a novel approach to study early human implantation, trophoblastic cell differentiation and trophoblastic invasion into human endometrial cells.', attributes={'Label': 'WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS', 'NlmCategory': 'CONCLUSIONS'})]
