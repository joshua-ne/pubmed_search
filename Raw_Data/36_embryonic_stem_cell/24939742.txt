DNA research : an international journal for rapid publication of reports on genes and genomes ['Rosette neural stem cells (R-NSCs) represent early stage of neural development and possess full neural differentiation and regionalization capacities. R-NSCs are considered as stem cells of neural lineage and have important implications in the study of neurogenesis and cell replacement therapy. However, the molecules regulating their functional properties remain largely unknown. Rhesus monkey is an ideal model to study human neural degenerative diseases and plays intermediate translational roles as therapeutic strategies evolved from rodent systems to human clinical applications. In this study, we derived R-NSCs from rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and systematically investigated the unique expressions of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and signalling pathways by genome-wide comparison of the mRNA and miRNA profilings of ESCs, R-NSCs at early (R-NSCP1) and late (R-NSCP6) passages, and neural progenitor cells. Apart from the R-NSCP1-specific protein-coding genes and miRNAs, we identified several pathways including Hedgehog and Wnt highly activated in R-NSCP1. The possible regulatory interactions among the miRNAs, protein-coding genes, and signalling pathways were proposed. Besides, many genes with alternative splicing switch were identified at R-NSCP1. These data provided valuable resource to understand the regulation of early neurogenesis and to better manipulate the R-NSCs for cell replacement therapy.']
