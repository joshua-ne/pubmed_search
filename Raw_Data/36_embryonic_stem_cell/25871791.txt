Biochemical and biophysical research communications ['Embryonic stem cells offer multiple advantages over adult stem cells in terms of achieving acceptable number of functional cardiomyocytes to be exploited in cell therapy. However, differentiation efficacy is still a major issue to be solved before moving to regenerative medicine. Although a vast number of chemical compounds have been tested on efficiency of cardiac differentiation, the effect of fish oil components, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on developmental bioenergetics, and hence cardiac differentiation, remained unstudied. EPA has been reported to have several cardioprotective effects, but there is no study addressing its role in cardiac differentiation. After mesoderm induction of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in hanging drops initiated by ascorbic acid, they were treated with various concentrations of EPA. Gene and protein expression and functional properties of cardiomyocytes derived from ESCs were evaluated following treatment with various concentrations of EPA. Exposure to low concentrations of EPA (10\xa0Î¼M) increased percentage of beating colonies and beating area. This treatment also resulted in up to 3 fold increase in expression of NKX2-5, MEF2C, MYH6, TNNT2 and CX43. FACS analysis confirmed gene expression analysis with increased percentage of MYH6 positive cells in EPA-treated group compared to the control group. In contrast, the expression of genes coding for cardiac differentiation, remained constant or even declined with higher concentrations of EPA. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that treatment of mESCs undergoing cardiac differentiation with low concentration, but not high concentration of EPA up-regulate transcription of genes associated with cardiac development.']
