Stem cells translational medicine [StringElement('Somatic stem cells play crucial roles in organogenesis and tissue homeostasis and regeneration and may ultimately prove useful for cell therapy for a variety of degenerative diseases and injuries; however, isolation and expansion of most types of somatic stem cells from tissues are technically challenging. Human pluripotent stem cells are a renewable source for any adult cell types, including somatic stem cells. Generation of somatic stem cells from human pluripotent stem cells is a promising strategy to get these therapeutically valuable cells. Previously, we developed a chemically defined condition for mouse hepatoblast self-renewal through a reiterative screening strategy. In the present study, we efficiently generated hepatoblasts from human embryonic stem cells by a stepwise induction strategy. Importantly, these human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatoblasts can be captured and stably maintained using conditions previously established for mouse hepatoblast self-renewal, which includes basal media supplemented with insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite, epidermal growth factor, glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor, transforming growth factor β receptor inhibitor, lysophosphatidic acid, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. The cells can stably retain hepatoblast phenotypes during prolonged culture and can differentiate into mature hepatocytes through in vitro provision of hepatocyte lineage developmental cues. After being embedded into three-dimensional Matrigel, these cells efficiently formed bile duct-like structures resembling native bile duct tissues. These human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatoblasts would be useful as a renewable source for cell therapy of liver diseases.', attributes={'Label': 'UNLABELLED'}), StringElement('Somatic stem cells have been proposed as promising candidates for cell-based therapy; however, isolation of somatic stem cells from adult tissues is usually invasive and technically challenging.
