Muscle & nerve [StringElement('We injected embryonic stem cells into mouse tibialis anterior muscles subjected to botulinum toxin injections as a model for reversible neurogenic atrophy.', attributes={'Label': 'INTRODUCTION', 'NlmCategory': 'BACKGROUND'}), StringElement('Muscles were exposed to botulinum toxin for 4 weeks and allowed to recover for up to 6 weeks. At the onset of recovery, a single muscle injection of embryonic stem cells was administered.
