Arthritis research & therapy [StringElement('The immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have prompted their therapeutic application in several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Adult MSC are finite and their clinical use is restricted by the need for long-term expansion protocols that can lead to genomic instability. Inhibition of Smad2/3 signaling in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) provides an infinite source of MSC that match the phenotype and functional properties of adult MSC. Here, we test the therapeutic potential of hPSC-MSC of embryonic origin (embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, hESC-MSC) in the experimental model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).', attributes={'Label': 'BACKGROUND', 'NlmCategory': 'BACKGROUND'}), StringElement("CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization with type II collagen (CII) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). Mice were treated with either a single dose (10(6) cells/mouse) of hESC-MSC on the day of immunization (prophylaxis) or with three doses of hESC-MSC every other day starting on the day of arthritis onset (therapy). Arthritis severity was evaluated daily for six weeks and ten days, respectively. Frequency of Treg (FoxP3(+)), Th1 (IFNγ(+)) and Th17 (IL17(+)) CD4(+) T cells in inguinal lymph nodes (ILN) was quantified by flow cytometry. Serum levels of anti-CII antibodies were determined by ELISA. Detection of hESC-MSC and quantification of murine and human indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO1) expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical differences were analyzed by ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test.", attributes={'Label': 'METHODS', 'NlmCategory': 'METHODS'}), StringElement('Administration of hESC-MSC to mice with established arthritis reduced disease severity compared to control-treated mice. Analysis of CD4 T cell populations in treated mice showed an increase in FoxP3(+) Treg and IFNγ(+) Th1 cells but not in Th17 cells in the ILN. Anti-CII antibody levels were not affected by treatment.
