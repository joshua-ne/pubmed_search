Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) ['The in vitro long-term cultivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from pre-implantation embryos offers the unique possibility of combining ES cells with pre-implantation embryos to generate chimeras, thus facilitating the creation of a bridge between in vitro and in vivo investigations. Genomic manipulation using ES cells and homologous recombination is one of the most outstanding scientific achievements, resulting in the generation of animals with desirable genome modifications. As such, the generation of ES cells with different ploidy via cell fusion also deserves much attention because this approach allows for the production of chimeras that contain somatic cells with various ploidy. Therefore, this is a powerful tool that can be used to study the role of polyploidy in the normal development of mammals.']
