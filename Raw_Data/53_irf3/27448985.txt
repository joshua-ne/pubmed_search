Oncotarget [StringElement('The urotensin II/urotensin receptor (UII/UT) system can mediate inflammatory liver injury in acute liver failure (ALF); however; the related mechanism is not clear. In this study, we confirmed that lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN) induced up-regulation of liver interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in ALF mice, whereas the UT antagonist urantide inhibited the up-regulated liver IRF3. LPS stimulation induced IRF3 transcription and nuclear translocation and promoted the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon (IFN)-β, and IFN-γ in Kupffer cells (KCs); these effects in LPS-stimulated KCs were inhibited by urantide. Knockdown of IRF3 using an adenovirus expressing an IRF3 shRNA inhibited IFN-β transcription and secretion as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β secretion from LPS-stimulated KCs; additionally, IL-10 transcription and secretion were promoted in response to LPS. However, LPS-stimulated TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA was not affected in the KCs. The IRF3 shRNA also did not have a significant effect on the NF-κB p65 subunit and p38MAPK protein phosphorylation levels in the nuclei of LPS-stimulated KCs. Therefore, IRF3 expression and activation depended on the signal transduction of the UII/UT system, and played important roles in UII/UT-mediated immune inflammatory injury in the liver but did not affect NF-κB and p38 MAPK activity.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'UNASSIGNED'})]
