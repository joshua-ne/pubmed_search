26445831 Currently the full-text not available Derivation and Chondrogenic Commitment of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitors. Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) ['The induction of human embryonic stem cells to a mesenchymal-like progenitor population constitutes a developmentally relevant approach for efficient directed differentiation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells to the chondrogenic lineage. The initial enrichment of a hemangioblast intermediate has been shown to yield a replenishable population of highly purified progenitor cells that exhibit the typical mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) surface markers as well as the capacity for multilineage differentiation to bone, fat, and cartilage. Herein, we provide detailed methodologies for the derivation and characterization of potent mesenchymal-like progenitors from hES cells and describe in vitro assays for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-mediated differentiation to the chondrogenic lineage.']
