27469204 Currently the full-text not available Protein phosphatase 1 abrogates IRF7-mediated type I IFN response in antiviral immunity. European journal of immunology [StringElement('Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a key role in the production of IFN-α in response to viral infection, and phosphorylation at IRF7 C-terminal serine sites is prelude to its function. However, phosphatases that negatively regulate IRF7 phosphorylation and activity have not been reported. In this study, we have identified a conserved protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding motif in human and mouse IRF7 proteins, and shown that PP1 physically interacts with IRF7. Exogenous expression of PP1 subunits (PP1α, β, or γ) ablates IKKε-stimulated IRF7 phosphorylation and dramatically attenuates IRF7 transcriptional activity. Inhibition of PP1 activity significantly increases IRF7 phosphorylation and IRF7-mediated IFN-α production in response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection or Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) challenge, leading to impaired viral replication. In addition, IFN treatment, TLR challenges and viral infection induce PP1 expression. Our findings disclose for the first time a pivotal role for PP1 in impeding IRF7-mediated IFN-α production in host immune responses.', attributes={'NlmCategory': 'UNASSIGNED'})]
