25410392 Currently the full-text not available Interferon regulatory factor 7- (IRF7-) mediated immune response affects Newcastle disease virus replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Acta veterinaria Hungarica ['Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is essential for the induction of an antiviral response. Previous studies have shown that virus replication causes the activation or expression of Type I interferon (IFN) in cells, which further activates IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to retard virus growth. In this study, after infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) with the lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain LaSota or the velogenic NDV strain GM, the mRNA and protein levels of IRF7 showed a significant increase, and part of the IRF7 protein was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In order to further explore the effect of IRF7-mediated innate immune response on the replication of NDV in CEFs, the mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT1 were measured and the replication kinetics of NDV determined. The results showed that specific siRNA could inhibit the expression of IRF7 and limit the mRNA level of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT1 and, accordingly, the replication kinetics of both NDVs were enhanced after the inhibition of IRF7. In conclusion, IRF7 is an important nuclear transcription factor for the induction of Type I IFNs during the antiviral response, which can affect the replication of NDV and spread to CEFs in the early phase of viral infection.']
