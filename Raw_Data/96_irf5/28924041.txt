28924041 Currently the full-text not available IRAK4 kinase activity controls Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation through the transcription factor IRF5 in primary human monocytes. The Journal of biological chemistry [u'Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) plays a critical role in innate immune signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and loss of IRAK4 activity in mice and humans increases susceptibility to bacterial infections and causes defects in TLR and IL1 ligand sensing. However, the mechanism by which IRAK4 activity regulates the production of downstream inflammatory cytokines is unclear. Using transcriptomic and biochemical analyses of human monocytes treated with a highly potent and selective inhibitor of IRAK4, we show that IRAK4 kinase activity controls the activation of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), a transcription factor implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. Following TLR7/8 stimulation by its agonist R848, chemical inhibition of IRAK4 abolished IRF5 translocation to the nucleus and thus prevented IRF5 binding to and activation of the promoters of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. We also found that IKK\u03b2, an upstream IRF5 activator, is phosphorylated in response to the agonist-induced TLR signaling. Of note, IRAK4 inhibition blocked IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation but did not block the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB, which was surprising, given the canonical role of IKK\u03b2 in phosphorylating I\u03baB to allow NF\u03baB activation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of either IKK\u03b2 or the serine/threonine protein kinase TAK1 in monocytes blocked TLR-induced cytokine production and IRF5 translocation to the nucleus, but not nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanism by which IRAK4 activity regulates TAK1 and IKK\u03b2 activation, leading to the nuclear translocation of IRF5 and induction of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes.']
