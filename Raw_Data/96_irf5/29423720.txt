29423720 Currently the full-text not available Association of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene polymorphisms with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Clinical rheumatology [u'Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a member of IRF family which induce signaling pathways and are involved in modulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune system activity. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an auto-inflammatory syndrome where the inflammatory markers are believed to play a fundamental role in its pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of IRF5 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility of JIA in Iranian population. Three IRF5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10954213 A/G, rs2004640 G/T, and rs3807306 G/T) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 55 patients with JIA and 63 matched healthy individuals. The frequency of the IRF5 rs2004640 T allele was significantly higher (69 vs 45%, P value\u2009=\u20090.0013) in JIA group as compared to control. The frequency of the IRF5 rs 2004640 G allele was significantly higher in the control group in comparison to JIA group (54 vs 32%, P value\u2009=\u20090.001). Allele and genotype frequencies of the rs10954213 and rs3807306 did not show any significant difference between JIA and control group. IRF5 rs 2004640 T allele can be considered as a risk factor for the development of JIA and presence of rs 2004640 G may be act as protective factor.']
