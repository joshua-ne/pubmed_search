The Indian journal of medical research [UnicodeElement(u'Genetic aberrations disrupting toll-like receptor and interferon homeostasis enhance the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Raised serum interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) levels in SLE patients have been ascribed to polymorphism (rs2004640 G/T) in interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene, resulting in enhanced transcript splicing. A positive association between IRF5 polymorphism and SLE risk has been reported in many populations.
