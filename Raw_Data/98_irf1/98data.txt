29893425 Currently the full-text not available IRF1 supports DNA binding of STAT1 by promoting its phosphorylation. Immunology and cell biology [u'The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a pivotal transcription factor in Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling, regulates the expression of a wide range of immune-related genes, including interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). In this study, we found that IRF1 could induce STAT1 phosphorylation and in turn STAT1 activation. When IRF1 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, STAT1 phosphorylated at Y701, dimerized and bound to an oligonucleotide containing a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) derived from the IRF1 promoter. IRF1 expression also induced GAS-dependent promoter reporter activity, and phosphorylation of JAK1, a kinase upstream of STAT1. Although no direct interaction between IRF1 and STAT1 was observed, the transactivation domain of IRF1 was required for IRF1-mediated STAT1 activation, indicating the involvement of gene product(s) regulated by IRF1. Moreover, supernatants from cells expressing IRF1 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and JAK1, and subsequent GAS binding by STAT1 that could not be blocked by treatment with antibodies against IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3-induced STAT1 phosphorylation persisted for up to 30\xa0h following stimulation of HEK293, but declined in IRF1-deficient HEK293 cells. IRF1-promoter activity induced by IFN-\u03b3 was also reduced in IRF1-deficient HEK293 cells, which could be rescued by complementation with IRF1. Together these results indicate that IRF1 promotes DNA binding of STAT1, which can in turn participate in a positive feedback loop of JAK-STAT signaling.'] 
29324236 Currently the full-text not available IRF1 up-regulates isg15 gene expression in dsRNA stimulation or CSFV infection by targeting nucleotides -487 to -325 in the 5' flanking region. Molecular immunology ["Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes a ubiquitin-like protein that is heavily involved in immune response elicitation. As an important member of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, IRF1 can activate the expression of multiple genes, including the human optineurin gene (Sudhakar et al., 2013). In this study, a sequence in the promoter region of the optineurin gene was compared to the 5' flanking region of the porcine isg15 gene. Porcine IRF1 also possesses antiviral activity against several swine viruses (Li et al., 2015), but the mechanism is not well understood. Herein, we report that porcine IRF1 and ISG15 were up-regulated in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells following stimulation with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection. We also found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of IRF1 expression resulted in lower ISG15 expression in response to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] or CSFV infection. The overexpression of IRF1 resulted in ISG15 up-regulation. IRF1 was shown to translocate to the nucleus in response to dsRNA stimulation. To further identify the functional domain of the isg15 gene that promotes IRF1 transcriptional activity, firefly luciferase and ISG15 reporter systems were constructed. The results of the firefly luciferase and ISG15 reporter assay suggested that IRF1 mediates the up-regulation of ISG15. Nucleotides -487 to -325, located in the 5' flanking region of the isg15 gene, constituted the promoter region of IRF1. ChIP assay indicated that IRF1 protein was able to interact with the DNA in the 5'fr of isg15 gene in cells. As an innate immune response protein with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, the up-regulation of ISG15 mediated by IRF1 in porcine cells is reported for the first time. These results warrant further investigation into the antiviral activity of porcine IRF1 against reported swine viruses."] 
29187542 Currently the full-text not available Type III Interferon Restriction by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and the Role of Viral Protein nsp1 in IRF1 Signaling. Journal of virology [u'Type III interferons (IFNs) play a vital role in maintaining the antiviral state of the mucosal epithelial surface in the gut, and in turn, enteric viruses may have evolved to evade the type III IFN responses during infection. To study the possible immune evasion of the type III IFN response by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells was developed as a cell model for PEDV replication. IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb3 inhibited PEDV replication, indicating the anti-PEDV activity of type III IFNs. Of the 21 PEDV proteins, nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp8, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), E, M, and N were found to suppress type III IFN activities, and IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) signaling mediated the suppression. PEDV specifically inhibited IRF1 nuclear translocation. The peroxisome is the innate antiviral signaling platform for the activation of IRF1-mediated IFN-\u03bb production, and the numbers of peroxisomes were found to be decreased in PEDV-infected cells. PEDV nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF1 and reduced the number of peroxisomes to suppress IRF1-mediated type III IFNs. Mutational studies showed that the conserved residues of nsp1 were crucial for IRF1-mediated IFN-\u03bb suppression. Our study for the first time provides evidence that the porcine enteric virus PEDV downregulates and evades IRF1-mediated type III IFN responses by reducing the number of peroxisomes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that emerged in swine in the United States and has caused severe economic losses. PEDV targets intestinal epithelial cells in the gut, and intestinal epithelial cells selectively induce and respond to the production of type III interferons (IFNs). However, little is known about the modulation of the type III IFN response by PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell model for PEDV replication. We found that PEDV inhibited IRF1-mediated type III IFN production by decreasing the number of peroxisomes in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. We also demonstrated that the conserved residues in the PEDV nsp1 protein were crucial for IFN suppression. This study for the first time shows PEDV evasion of the type III IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells, and it provides valuable information on host cell-virus interactions not only for PEDV but also for other enteric viral infections in swine.'] 
30145803 Currently the full-text not available miR-383 promotes cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through targeting IRF1. Journal of cellular biochemistry ["Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) has been found to serve as a tumor suppressor in cholangiocarcinoma, and enabled prediction of clinical progression and prognosis in our previous study. The objective of the current study is to screen and identify valuable microRNAs (miR), which target IRF1 to regulate cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High expression of miR-383 was observed in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cells. Meanwhile, we found the predicted binding site of miR-383 on the IRF1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) according to the miR target database. The miR-383 expression was negatively related to IRF1 messeneger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples, and miR-383 negatively regulated IRF1 mRNA and protein expression in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Subsequently, we conducted a luciferase reporter assay to prove the predicted binding site miR-383 on IRF1 3'-UTR. Moreover, the results of the rescue study suggested that IRF1 was a functional target of miR-383 involved in regulating cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Finally, we evaluated the clinical and prognostic significance of miR-383 in cholangiocarcinoma cases, and found that high expression of miR-383 was correlated with advanced tumor stage, large tumor size, present vascular invasion, and metastasis, and acted as an unfavorable independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, miR-383 serves as a tumor-suppressive miR to regulate cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via directly targeting IRF1."] 
28977839 Currently the full-text not available Genetic defects of the IRF1-mediated major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathway occur prevalently in the <i>JAK2</i> gene in non-small cell lung cancer. Oncotarget [u'Recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on tumor cells by cytotoxic T cells is involved in T cell-mediated tumor immune surveillance and immune checkpoint therapy. The interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-IRF1 signaling pathway regulates MHC class I antigen presentation. To examine genetic defects of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LuSc) data. Loss-of-function (LOF) genetic alterations of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway genes (<i>IFNGR1, IFNGR2, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, IRF1</i>) were found in 64 (6.3%) of 1,016 patients. These genetic defects occur prevalently in <i>JAK2</i> (33 cases) and often through deletions (29 cases) of chromosome 9p24.1. <i>JAK2</i> deletions were frequently, but not always, associated with deletions of PD-L1 gene (<i>CD274</i>), PD-L2 gene (<i>PDCD1LG2</i>), <i>PTPRD</i>, and <i>CDKN2A/CDKN2B</i> at the chromosome 9p24.1-9p21.3 region. <i>IRF1</i> expression was correlated with immune cytolytic activity markers <i>GZMA</i> and <i>PRF1</i> in NSCLC. IFN\u03b3 induced IRF1 expression and cell surface HLA-A/HLA-B/HLA-C (HLA-ABC) in A549, H661, H292, and H2172 cells that contained the wildtype JAK2, but not in H1573 and H1623 cells that were JAK2 defective. Deletion of <i>JAK2</i> or inhibition of the JAK2 kinase activity resulted in loss of IFN\u03b3-induced IRF1 and cell surface HLA-ABC in JAK2 wildtype NSCLC cells, whereas expression of exogenous JAK2 in H1573 cells restored the IFN\u03b3 responses. These findings show that <i>JAK2</i> deficiency is the major mechanism of genetic defects of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway in NSCLC and reveal a previously unrecognized significance of chromosome 9p deletion in NSCLC.']
