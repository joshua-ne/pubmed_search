28977839 Currently the full-text not available Genetic defects of the IRF1-mediated major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathway occur prevalently in the <i>JAK2</i> gene in non-small cell lung cancer. Oncotarget [u'Recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on tumor cells by cytotoxic T cells is involved in T cell-mediated tumor immune surveillance and immune checkpoint therapy. The interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-IRF1 signaling pathway regulates MHC class I antigen presentation. To examine genetic defects of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LuSc) data. Loss-of-function (LOF) genetic alterations of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway genes (<i>IFNGR1, IFNGR2, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, IRF1</i>) were found in 64 (6.3%) of 1,016 patients. These genetic defects occur prevalently in <i>JAK2</i> (33 cases) and often through deletions (29 cases) of chromosome 9p24.1. <i>JAK2</i> deletions were frequently, but not always, associated with deletions of PD-L1 gene (<i>CD274</i>), PD-L2 gene (<i>PDCD1LG2</i>), <i>PTPRD</i>, and <i>CDKN2A/CDKN2B</i> at the chromosome 9p24.1-9p21.3 region. <i>IRF1</i> expression was correlated with immune cytolytic activity markers <i>GZMA</i> and <i>PRF1</i> in NSCLC. IFN\u03b3 induced IRF1 expression and cell surface HLA-A/HLA-B/HLA-C (HLA-ABC) in A549, H661, H292, and H2172 cells that contained the wildtype JAK2, but not in H1573 and H1623 cells that were JAK2 defective. Deletion of <i>JAK2</i> or inhibition of the JAK2 kinase activity resulted in loss of IFN\u03b3-induced IRF1 and cell surface HLA-ABC in JAK2 wildtype NSCLC cells, whereas expression of exogenous JAK2 in H1573 cells restored the IFN\u03b3 responses. These findings show that <i>JAK2</i> deficiency is the major mechanism of genetic defects of the IFN\u03b3-IRF1 pathway in NSCLC and reveal a previously unrecognized significance of chromosome 9p deletion in NSCLC.']
