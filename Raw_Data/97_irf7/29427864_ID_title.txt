Seneca Valley Virus 3C<sup>pro</sup> abrogates the IRF3- and IRF7-mediated innate immune response by degrading IRF3 and IRF7. 29427864 Virology [u"Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) is a newly emerged virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Basic knowledge of the immunological response to SVV is limited. To date, one study has demonstrated that SVV 3C<sup>pro</sup> mediates the cleavage of host MAVS, TRIF, and TANK at specific sites and consequently escapes the host's antiviral innate immunity. In this study, we show that SVV 3C<sup>pro</sup> reduces IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression level and phosphorylation. SVV infection also reduces expression of IRF3 and IRF7 protein. The degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 is dependent on the 3C<sup>pro</sup> protease activity. We also identify interactions between 3C<sup>pro</sup> and IRF3 and IRF7 in PK-15 cells. A detailed analysis revealed that the degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 blocks the transcription of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b14, and ISG54. Together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism developed by SVV 3C<sup>pro</sup> to allow the virus to escape the host's intrinsic innate immune system."]
