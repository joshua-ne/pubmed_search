Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.) [StringElement('Increasing evidence indicate a critical pathogenic role of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interferon(IFN) inducible gene, IFIT3, is elevated in SLE. However, it is still not clear how IFIT3 contributes to SLE pathogenesis. We undertook this study to investigate the activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in SLE monocytes, as well as how elevated IFIT3 contributes to the overactivation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), StringElement('Monocytes from SLE patients or healthy controls were examined for the activity of cGAS-STING signaling pathway and expression of IFIT3. Then we analyzed the correlation between cGAS-STING signaling activity and SLE clinical features. Gain or loss of function experiments were used to determine the role of IFIT3 in cGAS-STING signaling pathway. We used Co-IP to identify the interaction between IFIT3 and other proteins.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'METHODS', u'Label': u'METHODS'}), UnicodeElement(u'cGAS-STING signaling pathway had enhanced activity in monocytes from SLE patients compared to healthy controls, indicated by higher expression of downstream IFN\u03b2. The expression of IFIT3 was significantly elevated and positively correlated with the activity of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. In vitro, we found that the expression of VACV70-induced IFN\u03b2 could be reduced by knocking down IFIT3, whilst over-expression of IFIT3 produced an opposite effect. Finally, IFIT3 was found to interact with both STING and TBK1.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'RESULTS', u'Label': u'RESULTS'}), StringElement('We propose that IFIT3 is one of the genes which contribute to the overactive cGAS-STING signaling pathway in SLE monocytes, which may serve as a therapeutic target to block the production of type I IFN and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by cGAS-STING signaling pathway.
